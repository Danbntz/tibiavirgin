I know there are some although none of them would dare to make his blasphemous opinions known in the public. How could the mighty pharaoh not ignore this ambitious fool and his futile plans. How haughtily he walked around in our beautiful Ankrahmun, mocking our true religion with his silly questions. Of course, he got nowhere and he seemed to give up in the end. But did the wisdom offered to him enlighten his blind soul? I think not. So full of himself was he, so firm in his heretic opinions and yet such a slave to his flesh - how could he understand that which is true and holy? People like him are both a curse and a blessing to us, the children of enlightenment.

But Shehamin, the second wife of the pharaoh, was not a woman to be fooled easily. Using cleverness and charm she brought his schemes to light and told her husband about them. Esuph III was furious, and his verdict on the fraudulent tax inspector was as cruel as it was clever: The screaming tax collector was sunk into a cauldron full of boiling gold. The terribly distorted statue which as the result of this peculiar treatment was put up in the tax office as a grim reminder that fraud can seriously affect your health.
