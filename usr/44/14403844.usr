Its rumored that beneath this isle are caves and dungeons of unknown but certainly ancient origin. \n\nOn the mainland is the city of Thais, ruled by the wise and just King Tibianus. His explorers found the new soulvortex on this isle and build this base to protect and train the incoming heroes.  \n\nIn the far northwest is the city of Carlin, that is ruled by amazons. The stuborn so called queen refuses to accept the rulership of the Thais monarchy over the whole continent. \n\nAt the great bay, east of Thais lies a rotten town of criminals. Little is known about it and only the most ruthles people even think about travelling there. \n\nThe dwarfen town, north of mount sternum, the central tibian mountainmassive, is the home of the tibian dwarfs. If you are looking for smiths of unparraleled skill you should travel there. \n\nFarer north, at the northern shores you find the elven city of Ab'Dendriel.
