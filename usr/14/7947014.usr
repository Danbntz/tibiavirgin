Two more of our adventurers (the ones I always tell about) were attacked by monsters:\nElaeus and the man, whos journey ended after 66 days, both were attacked by monsters. Both were jounger than Gadinius and the man who only barely escaped from the attacks of a mother-bear, who defended her babies. Heso, who too was one of our adventurers, never saw a bear in his whole life.\nOne of the five adventurers was attacked by a pack of trolls!", 2825 String="Dangers of Adventures\nby Netlios\n\nVolume V\n\nThe next thing, maybe the most important topic these days, we will closer examine, are monsters. Most adventurers die through monsters - be it because people are not well enough prepaired, be it because some people are surprised by eighter the apperance or the powers of a monster, be it because suddenly there are 20 monsters where you have expected only one. Always be aware: Our land is in fact dangerous and you always have to take into account that arround the next corner some monsters await you - monsters which you have never seen before!\nOf course, I have a little story on this topic:\nOne adventurer of the five - his trip was at least 18 days shorter than the trip of Hestus, who was one year jounger than him - climbed down a ladder, not thinking about the danger he might be in. When he finally touched the ground again, he saw himself eye in eye with a fire-spitting dragon. He tried to flee - too late. His body was found weeks after his death...\nJust to mention it: none of the two explorers mentioned above (Hestus and the man who was killed by a dragon) were 41 years old. The journey of the 41-year-old man was longer than the journey of the man who died during his adventure.", 2829 String="Dangers of Adventures\nby Netlios\n\nVolume I\n\nAn adventure is an exciting thing to do.

For example, you might cross a river or perhaps it\nmight rain one day or the other. And maybe you can even find drinks on your way, but be careful!\nYou never know what is inside the potion you find.\nLet me again give you an example to illustrate this:\nOne of our five men travelling through Tibia (his name was longer than the name of the adventurer,\nwho was attacked by a troll and therefore had to stop his exploration) one day found a filled\npotion on his way. He was very thursty, and so he drank the liquid inside. He didn't know (how should he?) that it was poisoned. After some moments he noticed, that he felt worse and worse. At this moment, he had to stop and return to his house.\nBy the way, the name of this man (the poisoned one) was shorter than the name of the man,\nwhose journey was over after 83 days.", 2821 String="Dangers of Adventures\nby Netlios\n\nVolume II\n\nThe adventurers, whom we will have a look at, were all born in different years and were\ntherefore all of different ages when they started their travellings through Tibia.\nThe oldest among these men was aged 42; the youngest was 38, when he started to discover\nnew areas of our land. None the five was as old as anyone else of them.\nOne journey ended after 83 days, one after 117 and finally one after 134 days.\nAnaso, one of the explorers, was a very brave sword-fighter.\nHis brother Elaeus, who started an expedition just like his brother, never wanted to use a sword -\ninstead he was an excellent magician.\nHestus, another explorer whom i will tell about, always wore green trousers, so no one saw\nhow dirty it was, and he never had to wash it.", 2828 String="Dangers of Adventures\nby Netlios\n\nVolume III\n\nThe first potential source of danger I want to discuss is fire!\nOf course, fire is necessary to survive wilderness - to cook our food, to have light, to warm ourselves in a cold and dark night...\nBut always take care: Fire doesn't help us all time! Let me give you an example:\nOne of our explorers was wounded badly, because he stepped into an open fire he made himself\nto cook some fish he just cought in the nearby river. Of course, this was the end of his journey;\nit was shorter than the travellings of the joungest among the five adventurers.", 2820 String="I found a strange-looking stone in the desert.
