She escaped on the\nother side and again rose over all elements, and began anew, to scorch these. When Suon followed her now, in order to punish\nher, she didn't let it come not a further test of strength and escaped the brother immediately. He followed the teasing and\naggravating sister tirelessly into the embrace of the fire. But Fafnar was a step ahead of him and had already fled again onto the\nother side over the elements ... and in such a way this continues to go on even today. \nUman united himself with the earth, which we know as Tibia. And the earth bore him Crunor, the first tree. Crunor was full of\ncharm and vitality. Also he loved his own shape, but he was wiser than Fafnar and possessed the gift of modesty.

You will find dungeons somewhere in the wilderness.\nDon't enter dungeons without equipment. Especially a rope and a shovel will prove valuable. Make sure you have a supply of torches with you, while wandering into the unknown. \nIt's wise to travel the dungeons in groups and not alone. For more help read all the books of the academy before you begin exploring. \nTraveling in the dungeons will reward the cautious and brave, but punish the reckless.\n", 2816 String="The Awaking of the Gods BOOK TWO \n\nFor a long time Fardos exhausted his enormous powers in futile activity. Finally he asked his companion for support in his\nattempts. Uman consented only too readily, but Zathroth, the dark one of the twins, refused himself. Thus Fardos and Uman\nstrived together to attempt the CREATION - however their laborings were not rewarded with success again. Just like before\neverything was drained away as soon as they created it, and Zathroth laughed full of contempt. \n      The power however, which Uman and Fardos spent, did seep away in the universe-filling void. Nobody knows\n      whether it was this power that lured another entity to them, whether it aroused this godly being, or whether in a\n      mysterious way it created this entity. In any event, suddenly the enormous entity Tibiasula rose from the void and\nexamined the two other godly beings. Fardos and Uman welcomed Tibiasula as their sister and admired her, because she was\nthe perfect unity of the elements.

He\nflattered her with compliments, and he succeeded in seducing her. \nThus they conceived Brog, the fiery raging berserker. Brog possessed only little of his fathers wisdom, and the heat of his\nmother burned only deep inside of him. There however the fire became more ravaging and more hurting, and the rough titan\nraged and cried that the elements were shaken. Inexpressible pain troubled him, until the blocheaded Brog compacted his\nmagical powers and hurled a major part of the fire far away from himself. From the fire, which did not want to cool down,\nhowever immediately the first dragon, called Garsharak, rose and he bore many further lower dragons in the course of the\ncenturies from his fire and his magic, of the like we know today.
