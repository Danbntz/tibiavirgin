Tibiasula agreed, because she also was fascinated by the idea\nof the creation. \nUman, whose nature was to win secrets and gain insights, had relized what their error at the preceding attempts had been:\nWithout a fixed pivot point there was no existence possible, and everything had to diffuse away as it was without direction and\ntarget. \nAnd to remedy that he invented TIME! \nIn order to create the time, the Gods united their powers. Even Zathroth was fascinated by the idea of his other half and\ncontributed a tiny proportion of his strength to the effort. The wise claim that it is to be due to his working that all time strives in\nthe long run to decay and destruction. \nThe powers of the godly bundled themselves to an enormous power greater than any in existence before. It began to\ncrystallize itself in the void to an enormous spiral. Higher and higher it mounted up, became firmness, pivot point, direction and\naim of existence! And in such a way the crystal column of time grew upwards and was from then on the unmovable center of\ncreation.
