Through this vortexportal many great heroes were able to  manifest themselves on Tibia. In their new bodys they fought againt the forces of destruction. But also agents of destruction and evil entered the world through this portal. More and more the dark forces used the portal to spread over Tibia and to annoy, disrupt and subvert the brave people of the world. Some of the evil spirits remained long enough in this world to wreak even more havoc on the good people of Tibia. Destruction of all that others had built, slaying of new manifested souls as soon as they left the vortex. \nThe gods watched in grief what had become of their great accomplishment. And one day Uman and Banor combined their awesome forces and split the vortex. One strand now aimed to the isle of rookgaard, the other one remained aimed on the temple of Thais. \nFrom this day on the newborn heroes awakened on the holy and protected isle of rookgaard and only the stronger and better prepared souls could travel to the continent. \nGuided by omens an expedition of brave warriors from the thaian order of the knights of noodles traveled the perillious seas the the remote isle of rookgaard and discovered the new soulvortex. \nSoon this base was built and this fine academy founded. \n\nPraise the gods and our King.", 2920, 2920, 2920, 3492 Amount=80}}}
