What we found out you would probably need are the remains of a slain stone golem, the branch of a willow, the wing of a wasp, and a flask full of slime. Pour the slime into a cold cauldron and add in the other ingrediants into the cauldron and boil it. This seems to be the base of a powerful potion, though the finalization and the spells needed to enchant it are still a riddle to be solved.\n", 2816 String="The Prisonisle\n\nMost of the rebelious dwarves who betrayed us and allied themselves with the cyclopses and some dishonorfull human knights were prosecuted and thrown in jail on the prisonisle Dwacatra.

Place the ingredients into a flask of the mad mage valley water, cork it and boil it. Remove the cork and pour a small amount of the potion into a cup and shake it. Now we have to find out how to bring in the silence gefore dawn in an appropriate way. You should then have a full cup of beer if all works as calculated so far. We estimate one potion should be a weeks suply of beer if you minimize your drinking to 7 mugs a day. \n(Oh, and don't tell jimbin about this spell) \n\nThose are the findings. It was also found that the water that flows by the mad mage valley is quite magical. One of our mages suggested that it is the \"soul of the sea\".

A particular emphasis of the work is the fascinating ghoulish healing habits, which the author presumes to be, unlike many warriors thinks nowadays, an effective romantic ritual which ghouls aims to the creatures they do found appealing somehow.", 2816 String="Dwarven report VII\nEnemy magic\n\nOur elemantarists have successfully unrevealed the the secrets of what is called \"dream magic\". It is a subconscious way of influencing the surroundings. It is mainly used by elven parents that want to shape their unborn child, but, this is the far more important threat, some elves, especially those called \"Teshial\" posess the ability to wander some kind of \"dream realm\" instead of the real world. This gives them the oppurtunity to appear somewhere out of the blue, but, fortunately, the Teshial never used this skill to ambush, and the other elves posess only small remnants of this magic.\nNever the less, the 2nd earthen chamber is evolving a counter spell for that, that increases the elemental signature of beings near, forcing them into the real realm.\n\nThe other kinds of their magics are limited to protective and growing spells, whicht yet do not prove any harm, but are very supportive for their strife. It is rumored that they have also a lot of illusionary and concealing spells, but investigations here have not yet led to final results, as well as we can only deny the existance of aggressive magic by an elven race od caste od unknown origin.\n\nFor further information refer to sub-report AX-27.\n", 2816 String="Dwarven report XII\nEnemy territory and settlements\n\nOur scouts recently discovered a great number of elven hideouts within the \"deeper woodlands\". They also have a great city, comparable to a capital, there, which is called Ab'Dendriel, and is mainly inhabitated by Deraisim and Cenath. The defenses are rather weak, and it seems like a lot of nomads and wanderers pass through the region.\n\nWe also found ruins within the hidden mystic valley, the structure of the buildings is typically elven. The ruins seem to be the result of a harsh thunderstorm of magic, but it was too long ago for us to find closer traces.\n\nMore interesting should be the fact, that the volcanic regions beyond the thundery mountains seem to be colonised by the elves as well. There dwells a race called Kuridai, and they seem to be the most aggressive and militant elves we encountered yet.\n\nSuggestions about possible assault targets if war will be at hand are envoiced in sub-report EY-01.\n", 2816 String="Dwarven Magic I\nBy Marokin \n\nMost of the other races look down upon the Dwarves because we seem to lack in magical abilites. What they don't understand is that our best mages concentrate on the magic of earth and fire, the give and take. They come up with some magic that might give us the upper hand. In theese books I will reveal some of their findings. ", 2816 String="As intensely as the orcs hate all other races, they share a feeling of community. The orcs can sense, to some extent, the feelings of other orcs. The shamans develop this ability to such an extent, that they can sense the innermost potential of newborn orc whelps. All newborn are tested and the shamans decide a future function in orcish society. The whelps are fed differently, raised differently, and educated differently. Wise men of other races say that such behavior is similar to some insects, such as bees, and through their empathetic bond might share a kind of 'hive-mind', so they refer to orc communities as hives. The chief of a hive owns a big harem of women who have no other function than to pleasure him and give birth to new orcs. These orcish matrons are usually incredibly big and fat, almost not able to walk on their own. Where 'normal' orcwomen function as laborer and craftwomen and give birth to two to three orcs in their lives, these female orcs are only reproductive machinery, giving birth to about six whelps each half year. Orcs are usually contend with their place in orcish society and only the leaders fight each other on purpose. Rarely will an orc raise a weapon against another orc, even if they are not of the same hive. Rivalry between hives is usually dissolved through a fight of their leaders and the victorious hive absorbs the other one. Now and then, when a new strong warrior reaches maturity he challenges the old leader for a fight of supremacy. Sometimes though, when the hive becomes too big for the area it occupies, such a warrior senses somehow that its time to move on. Then he and a few other orcs leave the hive in peace to settle somewhere else. This unique culture, together with its fertility, makes the orcs the most formidable threat to all other tibian communities. ", 2816 String="Introduction of the War of Welcome \n\nThe War of Welcome took place near the southern bridge, that the humans call 'the dwarf bridge'. The southern territory was once inhabited by a mighty orcish tribe and the few dwarves brave enough to stick around the mountain were constantly being hasseled by these orcish people and some were enslaved by the vile orcs! To the Northwest lie Carlin, a place inhabited by humans who struggled for survival on their own and could not help the dwarves in this matter either. As time went by the dwarves who called for war against the orcis raiders grew in number and voice. They felt they had a right to reatake these lands from the orcish invaders. \n", 2816 String="The elves are able to manipulate their unborn children by some kind of dream magic. This magic changes appearance and personality slightly, allowing elven parents to give birth to 'wish-kids'. In their shared dreams the elven parents seem to sculpture their child like a piece of art. Though most of the dream magic of the past is long forgotten, this rudimentary magic seems to be natural to the elves. It is possible to 'choose' things like hair or eye color and even gender. Even slight changes of the physique are possible, though considerable changes take place in the span of generations. Wise men assume this ability was a 'gift' of the gods to make more adaptable tools for the elves' war. But the mentality of the elves did not allow them to form their children in a 'convenient' way. Since most of this magic is instinctual, they form their children in an aesthetic way. On the other hand, what is seen as aesthetic is based on the philosophy of the parents and so their background changes this view dramatically. This is even more evident in the castes that were separated in the war.

Light a fire with the flame of the fire element. Pour the water from Blood Bay into a cauldronand place it over the fire. Throw in the head of the ghoul and the essence of the red royal Blossom and mix it untill a grey myst emerges. Take some of the potion and mix it with the laugh while cooling it.
