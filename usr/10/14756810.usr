And how much greater was his surprise to find that the Marid fled to the city of Ankrahmun where they appeared were expected! It was then that he realised that Gabel had suspected a ruse all along, and that he had prepared a counterstrategy. Malor immediately ordered his troops to abandon pursuit, but it was too late. The undead marched against Ankrahmun with all the determination of a mindless killing machine, and the Efreet, blinded by rage, did not lag behind, only to be met by ceaseless barrages of arrows and catapult stones. A cataclysmic battle ensued.  \nWave after wave of undead and Efreet stormed against Ankrahmun, and wave after wave broke at the huge fortifications of the ancient city. Both the Marid and the humans were well-prepared for this battle, and even though Malor's army wreaked havoc they never yielded. ", 3077, 2831 String="The Djinn Wars III - The Great Battle, Pt. 4\n\nThe fire, now entirely out of control, turned northwards, driven by a gently breeze coming from the south. Its devastating flames fed on plants and animals alike, and as the inferno slowly spread to the north the Kha'labal was scorched and marred forever by the magical flame. \nThus, the great battle was won by the allied armies of the Marid and the humans. However, for the winners there was little left to feel triumphant about. The losses had been great on both sides, and the Kha'labal, that beautiful garden given to the humans by the gods, had been turned into a barren, hostile desert. Also, the destruction cause the fire had allowed many Efreet to escape, so it seemed unlikely that the war would end now. However, for the time being Malor and his troops were much too weak to pose a serious military threat, so Gabel decided to abandon pursue. Instead he ordered that his army should move northwards towards Drefia. It seemed time to settle old scores.", 3077, 2656, 2831 String="The Djnn Wars IV - Drefia's Fall\n\nAfter the disastrous battle of Ankrahmun Drefia's necromancers knew the end was near. The Marid would never forgive them their treachery, and this would be a battle the necromancers could not win - after all, many of them had already perished in the battle of Ankrahmun, and their Efreet allies could provide no assistance. So the necromancers prepared for the inevitable with the defiant cynicism of those who have been familiar with death all their lives, performing evil rituals and indulging in morbid orgies.\nFinally, the end came swifter than they expected. Unwilling to take any risks in the unpredictable halls and passageways of Drefia's dungeons, the Marid performed a fearsome ritual. The tortured earth underneath Drefia started moving like a giant whirlpool, and slowly the unholy city was pulled inside the maelstrom. Within half an hour it was gone completely, and all but the highest buildings were completely covered by sand and by rubble. None of its inhabitants have ever been seen again, but rumour has it that deep beneath the surface the unholy city is still intact, brooding like a vengeful animal in its prison.", 3077, 2656, 3655, 3655, 3658, 2866, 2656, 2656, 2656, 3658, 3658, 3655, 2656, 2656, 2656, 2656, 3074, 3425, 3577 Amount=2, 3502 Content={3578 Amount=8, 2853 Content={3354, 3358, 2853 Content={3286, 2853 Content={2853 Content={2853 Content={2853 Content={2853 Content={2869 Content={3286, 3358, 3358, 3354}, 3286, 3286, 3354, 3286, 3354, 3264}, 3354, 3286, 3358, 3483, 3354}, 3286, 3286, 3354, 3354, 3286, 3358}, 3286, 3354, 3264, 3358, 3286, 3286}, 3354, 3354, 3264, 3354}, 3358, 3264, 3358, 3264, 3286}, 3286}, 3578 Amount=100, 3031 Amount=35, 3003, 3457}},
