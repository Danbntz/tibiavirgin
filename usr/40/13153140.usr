The battles were furious and bloody and for along time no side was\napparently winning. Uman gave humans the art of magic and instructed them in the magic crafts. But even the sorcerers could\nnot turn the tables. Some of them turned thereupon away from Uman and called Crunor their lord, in order to serve from then\non as druids for the forces of the life. Together with the godly world tree Crunor they created many of the creatures, that\npopulate the wilderness today, although a variety of these creatures was extinguished in the wars of that time. \nBanor however chose the noblest of the mortal ones, Kirana, as its wife, and she bore him Elane, which possessed as much\nvirtue as combat and magical powers. And she became the first of the noble paladins. Until our times the leader of the paladins\nis in honors to her a woman and assumes the honorary name Elane.

Until today\nnone of the old peoples has recovered from the great war. Tibia was completely scattered with the corpses of the great battle,\nand all life threatened to be suffocated thereby. \nThere the gods decided that Uman should unite with the earth in order to create a godly being, which would take care of the\ndead. But Zathroth used a deception and appeared to the earth as its other side, Uman, and conceived in his place a being.\nThis was the birth of Urgith, the master of the undead. \nAnd immediately the dead ones began to raise themselves on his calling, and they all were his creatures. Like the orcs before\nthem, now the undead covered the body of the mother Tibia, and his children, the rats, were Urgith's messengers and scouts. \nThen however Uman and Tibia united, as it had been agreed upon, and Toth was born. Toth became the guardian of the\ndead ones and sent his large worms which began to devour the undead. For a long time the struggle lasted and again no end\nwas to be foreseen. ", 2816 String="The War over the Creation BOOK FOUR\n\nThe good Gods created and threw race after race into the struggle about the world. All of them were defeated! Almost\neveryone of the old races, which we know only as the Ancients, was defeated and buried by the sands of the time, because\nthey were no match to the agressive rage and the emotionless intrepidity of their opponents. \nAccording to our knowledge, only the delicate elves in their cities deep in the forests and the dwarves in their fortresses deep\nunder the mountains survived the corpse wars, although at some campfires rumors are spread about other races, created by\nboth sides for this unholy war, and of which some individuals are said to still be around. \nJust as strong and powerful as these peoples were, they were one-sided and of little flexibility. Worse still: Some creatures\nsuccumbed to the temptations of Zathroth about power and great knowledge. They switched sides, and rumor has it that the\nmost powerful of the Ancients were hurled out of this world by the good Gods for their betrayal to suffer eternally in the sphere,\nwhich was created in order to punish them for their misdeeds, and changed to what nowadays is called the daemons. \nAll their magic, which was probably given to the old peoples in excess, could not make them victorious, and they and their\nbuildings disappeared gradually from the face of Tibia.", 2816 String="The Creation of Humans BOOK THREE\n\nAll this however could not turn the war luck against the dark hordes. Whereever Banor appeared personally to lead the\narmies of humans, they triumphed, but on the other battlegrounds they were too often crushed by the dark crowds. \nThus Banor asked the gods to help him and the gods in their infinite wisdom created the portal of the souls. By means this\nmystic of gate souls from planes of existence far, far away of Tibia could be called in order to assume the shape of heroes. \nWith these champions as leaders the humans turned the tables in the great war. They alone under all the mortals had the\npossibility of becoming similar to Banor, uniting power and cunning.

The world was fragile, the boundaries between the worlds cracked by the enormous powers, which had been\nemployed. Already the armies of the older races were readying themselves to recapture from the humans what the old ones\nregarded as theirs. Already the children of the darkness, hardly troubled by the undead, risen again to new powers, were\nwaiting to spread chaos over the world. Already the dragons sharpened their talons on their rock, in order to rise again into air\nto devastate the world in a fiery nightmare. Already the victorious armies of humans threw possessive looks on new targets.\nAlready the daemons hammered on the walls of their breakable prison. ", 2816 String="The rat - I fear we brought this pest with us on the isle and they soon increased in numbers. You might encounter the rats nearly everywhere, though they prefer to live undergound. \nMostly harmless, they tend to destroy food supplies and can become dangerous in greater numbers to the bad equiped human.\n\nThe snake - The poisonous snakes hide in the woods and near the northern swamps. They usually can be found at the shores more often then in the isles centre. They are not too dangerous to a adventurer with some basic equipment. If poisoned it is a wise decision to run straight to the monk who guards the soul vortex, where everyone enters the world of Tibia, and ask for healing.\n\nThe spider - Similarly dangerous as the rat, the spiders were found by the first explorers of the isle and are native to Rookgard. They live above and beneath ground and tend to live and hunt in packs to increase their danger.\n\nThe wolf - There are some smaler wolf packs on this isle. Wolves are fast, tough and dangerous. Often they are the hunters and not the hunted on this island. It is a good decision to engage them in combat only with decent equipment and try to fight them only one on one.\n\nThe troll - Though intelligent in a limited way, the cowardish trolls are not a threat to our small outpost. They are able to create and use some basic equipment and quite tough to lesser weapons and unskilled fighters. Follow the advise to have mastered some basics in shielding, before you challenge even one of them.\n\nThe bear - Bears are hard to beat! Keep that in mind before challenging one.

On rookguard there is an oaklike plat which fruits resemble Bannanas in shape and tase that much. noone can make out the difference of the fruits. To all persons without knowledge in botanology the only hint to find a bannanatree is the witheblossom flower that often seems to live in a kind of symbiosis with the cherry tree. \nThe dragontongue plant is easily spotted by its deep red blossoms and rumored to be an usefull reagent in varrious alchemical potions. \nThe swamplants re that numerous and various that we didn't have a chance for an extensive calssification.

They looked down upon the desintegrating world, and they decided an armistice,\nbecause they all wanted power over the creation, not its complete destruction. Thus the Gods threw the charm of the new\nbeginning over the world! Only gradually the recovering sections of the old world started to rise from the nebulas of time,\nawakened the old races and old frights back to life. It is said that the city of Tibia was the first to rise again, barren of almost all\nlife, without all magic, on a tiny island, deserted and almost devoid of life ... and nevertheless full of age-old secrets. And soon\nafterwards life returned to the world. \nAlso via the portal of souls old and new heroes found their way to Tibia. Gradually larger sections of the old world emerged\nfrom the nebulas, further natures and miracles. But the world is still far from its former splendour and size, and we live in times\nof change. What today is still natural, may as soon as tomorrow be only a legend, what today is still fantasy, may already\ntomorrow be reality. \nBut hear ye and listen: Bad spirits also arrived and still arrive by the portal in our realm, in order to do mischief in human\nshape.

And as the\ndivinity was weakened by the creation and without suspicion and resistance, the deadly attack penetrated to the core of her\nbeing and destroyed her. \nThe elements - fires, water, earth and air - were jerked out of their harmony and landed at the base of the column of time.", 2816 String="The Creation of Humans BOOK ONE\n\nThere the Gods created the first human, Banor, the godly warrior! This entity was filled by the godly power and was full of\ncourage and responsibility. After his image and with parts of his body the Gods created him attendants, Humans. \nNobody knows, which Gods brought their powers into the recent creation, and some say that Zathroth spoiled also this\ncreation. Yes, some even state that the good Gods created a twin for Banor, which should embody the powers of magic,\nwhose raw form however was stolen by Zathroth, and he had manufactured from it the first daemonic lords to lead his\nattendants from hell. \nWhichever it might be, in any case the humans took on the fight against the crowds of the undead and probably against the\ndragons, orcs and their unholy attendants, too, and Banor was a glorious leader for mankind.

They decided to create from the elements\nsomething new, similar to Tibiasula. For a long time they looked for a way of achie this end. Finally Uman found a solution: the\nbirth, which created live from live. One of the Godly had to unite with one of the elements and could thus create a new entity. \nThus Fardos and the Fire united, and the Fire bore two children, Fafnar and Suon, the Suns of Tibia. Suon of calm and\nconsiderate nature. But Fafnar, its sister, was self-willed and stubborn. She rose vainly over the elements and began to scorch\nthem. Therefore Suon also rose up in order to stop his sister. A wild struggle started and pretty soon it turned out that Suon\nwas the stronger one of the two. So Fafnar fled under Tibia into the parental fire, but Suon wanted his sister to promise him\nnever to scorch the other elements again. ", 2816 String="Tactics handbook - Use train to your advantage.

But the girl was warned of treacherous gnomes by a valiant huntsman she met before and she quickly ran away from the greedy little gnome. The gnome became angry but was afraid to steal from her, because she might have been stronger than him. So he wandered into the woods cursing as only gnomes can curse (and that's pretty ugly). By chance he almost stumbled over a sleeping bard. Quickly figuring out the magical nature of the flute lying near the sleeping bard, he stole it as quickly as only a gnome can do (and that's pretty quick). Using the magic flute he lured a pack of wolves to the little girls grandmas house and let the beasts chase both into the wilderness and laughed wickedly as only gnomes can laugh (and that's pretty wicked).

Still the bad orcs, equipped with cyclop weapons, were too powerful\nand too malicious. \nBut when the Orks threatened to cover Tibia almost completely, the dragon came! They had decided that only they\nthemselves were to be the true and absolute rulers of Tibia. They did know no mercy in their rage!

Tibiasula agreed, because she also was fascinated by the idea\nof the creation. \nUman, whose nature was to win secrets and gain insights, had relized what their error at the preceding attempts had been:\nWithout a fixed pivot point there was no existence possible, and everything had to diffuse away as it was without direction and\ntarget. \nAnd to remedy that he invented TIME! \nIn order to create the time, the Gods united their powers.

The wise claim that it is to be due to his working that all time strives in\nthe long run to decay and destruction. \nThe powers of the godly bundled themselves to an enormous power greater than any in existence before. It began to\ncrystallize itself in the void to an enormous spiral. Higher and higher it mounted up, became firmness, pivot point, direction and\naim of existence!
