Aforesaid mage from the Noodles Academy of Magic Arts came here to study the different cultures of the area. After three days of preparation and planning, his room was found empty. His bed was unused but his clothes lay neatly folded on a chair as if he had undressed. There were no signs of a fight and the door had been locked from within. It is a complete mystery why or how he disappeared. \n", 2833 String="Report 56IOLP56\nThe respectable mage Borsoz was able to provide us with a cure for the so-called 'jungle fever'. People repeatedly reported some kind of 'out-of-body experience'. While sleeping, they suddenly stood beside their own body and watched over it. The magician proved that the 'fever' actually was caused by a small bug. This bug injects a mildly toxic hallucinogen into the body of a sleeping person causing the mentioned phenomenon. Borsoz developed a paste that, when applied to the walls and the floor, keeps those bugs away. All settlers were provided with the paste and the \"fever\" has been efficiently eradicated. "}},
