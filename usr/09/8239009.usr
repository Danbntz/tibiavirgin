               8 Content={2821 String="The Pyramids of the Apes Vol.1\nHaving experienced the apes as a very primitive culture, the rumors and stories about them living in a pyramid city, not unlike that of the far away Ankrahmun, seemed unbelivable at first. On second thought though we have to admit that we have seen stranger things than this in our lovely world. But how could those primitive apes build a pyramid city like this? How could they aquire such heights of architecture while they can hardly wield a weapon and have only a remote grasp to the concept of clothing? The answer is quite obvious though.\nWe know that the pyramid architecture of Ankrahmun has been used for its spiritual value long before the reign of Arkhotep. We also know that Ankrahmun is a city of the dead. As a matter of fact it is also true that in Ankrahmun the wisdom of many ages has been gathered and philosophy and science prospered like nowhere else in this world. It is obvious that the pyramids are linked to death and to wisdom somehow. If you put two and two together, you can easily figure out that those pyramids act as a collector of spiritual energy and probably even literally as houses of the dead. Imagine a civilisation that could have conversations with its dead ancestors and draw from the enormous source of their wisdom! Would such a civilisation not prosper like that of Ankrahmun? For sure it would.\nBut how is this connected to the apes and their pyramids one might ask. The answer is simple: being the primitive beings they are, the apes are unable to build such structures but some spirits of the past with the wisdom of millennia might have that knowledge. We all know that a primitive mind can be easily controlled. So it would be easy for such a spirit to take over control of the simple mind of one or more apes and give them orders. Without knowing what they were doing such mind-controlled apes could have built this city of pyramids. Of course the apes would have no need for such a city, but surely the ghosts or spirits would like to call such a place their home.", 2816 String="The Ghosts of the Jungle\nEven though it is true that many people who have not returned from the jungle have fallen prey to animals and other natural dangers, it is quite sure that not in all cases this explanation is applicable. For all we know it is quite certain that there have to be other dangers in the jungle than such mundane ones. How can it be explained that several watchmen of expeditions have vanished over night while none of the people asleep in the camp was harmed? How is it possible that well armed and seasoned adventurers got lost in the jungle? Considering the expertise of some of the victims this jungle has taken, it would be highly ignorant to assume that a simple beast of some kind could be the source of their ultimate doom. In conclusion we have to assume that 'something' is out there. A malicious, unseen power. Never seen but often felt. Noticed only by the 'inner eye' but never actually seen. Everybody that has ever set foot in the jungle knows this eerie feeling of being watched and traced. Sometimes you can almost imagine the movements of something invisible in the bushes. \nAnd do all those glowing eyes in the darkness belong to animals? I don't think so.", 2821 String="The Lizard People\nIt seems the lizards we encountered in the jungle are some sort of civilised culture. When I speak of culture, I relate them only to primitive orcs and minotaurs of course. During our expeditions to the jungle we learned that they are hostile to humanity like most of the vile creatures of this new land. Their animosity also spreads to most other races we encountered here. They seem to be a warlike race, searching for conflicts and fights with each and everyone they encounter. Obviously this mindless aggression leaves little room to develop a culture like the human one,  achieved due to a long history. It is unlikely those primitive brutes even know the very concept of history at all. \nThis leaves one to wonder who supplies them with their exotic weaponary and armor. Perhaps they are some minor race of a greater dark power that lurks in the deepest depths of the jungle. The magic I have seen performed by those lizards was far from impressive. They use a very limited variety of shamanistic tricks that are insignificantly more powerful than the powers those average orcish hive shamans hold. \nTo sum things up, the lizard people are another hostile race that might be seen as a hindrance for humankind but they do not pose a threat. On the other hand they are of no use to us and a timely elimination could only be helpful.", 2821 String="The Pyramids of the Apes Vol.2\nAfter obtaining their base, the spirits must have stopped controlling the apes which resulted in random raids that are too well known by the inhabitants of Port Hope and that formed their opinion about those creatures. The lack of organisation and control in those attacks makes it obvious that there is no higher power behind them. It seems that the spirits have now left the pyramids since the rare reports we receive from that place, tell us that the once grand structures are now overgrown ruins. Would the spirits allow their home to decay in such a way? I would highly doubt that. There are only two explanations for this phenomenon. The first possibility is that the spirits have left our world. This would be reasonable if you assume that taking control over a living being costs some powers and might have drained all energy from the spirits. But wouldn't those pyramids cancel this effect? For sure they would. So another reason for the spirits' departure could be that the spirits gathered enough energy through the pyramids that allowed them to travel to another dimension or reach a new state of being (or death). So the spirits have no use of the pyramids anymore. The second theory for the spirits' disappearance is much more worrying: the spirits are only asleep. Perhaps the process of becoming one with the field energy of the pyramids was so exhausting that the spirits had to take some rest. If this is the case, they could wake up anytime. And nobody can foresee how they will react to us living intruders who could pose a dangerous threat to their spiritual home.\n", 2821 String="We finally made it to trick the foolish dragon and advance to some better part of earth. Here it is easy to dig a new dungeon. I hope we will find a new way out.\n\nThe way is long. We are digging for about 30 days.\n\nWe made it to advance to a stone wall! Tomorrow we will break it! The day we will see the sun again is close! Palker will be proud of me!\n\nYeah! This was the final blow. The wall is broken! But, what is that? Behind the wall, there is a human warrior.
