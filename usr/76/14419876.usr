Finally he asked his companion for support in his\nattempts. Uman consented only too readily, but Zathroth, the dark one of the twins, refused himself. Thus Fardos and Uman\nstrived together to attempt the CREATION - however their laborings were not rewarded with success again. Just like before\neverything was drained away as soon as they created it, and Zathroth laughed full of contempt. \n      The power however, which Uman and Fardos spent, did seep away in the universe-filling void. Nobody knows\n      whether it was this power that lured another entity to them, whether it aroused this godly being, or whether in a\n      mysterious way it created this entity. In any event, suddenly the enormous entity Tibiasula rose from the void and\nexamined the two other godly beings. Fardos and Uman welcomed Tibiasula as their sister and admired her, because she was\nthe perfect unity of the elements. Zathroth however fumed with silent hate, as he didn't want to share the void with one more\nentity.", 2816 String="The Creation of Humans BOOK THREE\n\nAll this however could not turn the war luck against the dark hordes. Whereever Banor appeared personally to lead the\narmies of humans, they triumphed, but on the other battlegrounds they were too often crushed by the dark crowds. \nThus Banor asked the gods to help him and the gods in their infinite wisdom created the portal of the souls. By means this\nmystic of gate souls from planes of existence far, far away of Tibia could be called in order to assume the shape of heroes. \nWith these champions as leaders the humans turned the tables in the great war. They alone under all the mortals had the\npossibility of becoming similar to Banor, uniting power and cunning. Thus the hordes of undead and their terrible leaders were\nslowly but inexorably overwhelmed.", 2853}},
