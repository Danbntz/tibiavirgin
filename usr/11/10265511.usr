And even though many djinns disdained their king's new favourite Gabel increasingly sought Daraman's company. Every day they went to the Gabel's personal garden and talked for many hours. It turned out that Gabel, the mighty djinn king who had been the terror of the world for such a long time, was plagued by a terrible feeling inner void, and Daraman's infinite spiritual strength became a source of joy and of redemption for him. And so, day by day and week by week, their relationship slowly changed from one between prisoner and a king to one between a master and his disciple.", 2831 String="The Djinn Wars VI - A War in Suspension\n\nWith Malor imprisoned, many Marid hoped that peace would finally come. Gabel immediately contacted the Efreet to let them know their leader was his prisoner, but his hopes that the rebellion would collapse without Malor were disappointed. The Efreet hated their Marid cousins too much to yield, and so the war continued. Nonetheless, both sides tried to avoid open conflicts, so there was next to no combat action for a long, long time. In fact, both the Marid and the Efreet planned to wait until their ranks would be replenished. But the losses they had suffered were great, and the djinns are not a fertile race. Century upon century passed and still their numbers had increased little. And while elsewhere the human race rose to power, building beautiful cities and establishing powerful empires, the djnn lived quiet in their remote fortresses. Malor, however, remained imprisoned in Fa'hradin's lamp, oblivious to the strange land his guardians had taken him.
