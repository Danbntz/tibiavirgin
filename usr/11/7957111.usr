Only the bravest warriors dare to challenge them, and most of these fools join the ranks of the mummies' undead legions all too soon. In life, each of these ancient horrors was a champion in his own right, but now that they have entered the dreadful state of undeath they have become truly formidable, for there is no way to kill them for good.

And Arkhothep forged the parts of a powerful mask and assembled it on a demon altar. He had secretly erected this unholy shrine underneath the great pyramid he had planned to use as the final resting place for his father. So strong was this altar's magic that it fused the parts to form the famous Helmet of the Ancients as soon as they were placed on it. Eight helmets Arkhothep crafted, one for himself and one for each of his allies. But he did not fully trust his fellow conspirators, so he inserted ordinary rubies into their helmets, while his own helmet was imbued with the eternal power of a soul ruby. This way those helmets had only a fraction of his own helmet's powers. But Arkhothep's precautions against his allies went further than that. He only revealed the secret to forge one single part of the helmet to each of them, and each of them was taught the secret to forge a  different part. Arkhothep clearly saw through his allies' greedy natures. He knew they would never share their knowledge with each other, and he foresaw that their greed would make them plot against each other rather than against him.", 2816 String="The lost garden\nPrincess Maharuh was said to be the kindest creature that ever walked the earth. She was dearly loved both by her people and by the djinns. One day as the princess wept because of all the pain and the evil ways of the world the djinns came to comfort her. And since they loved her so much they called upon their powers to grow a garden of magnificent beauty. From now on, Maharuh visited her enchanted garden whenever she was sad, and she never went there but a smile came to her face, and she found new strength to continue her work with renewed vigour and inspiration. But humans grow old and weary, and time did not fail to do its cruel work on fair Princess Maharuh. As she grew old her visits to the garden became less and less frequent and one day when she laid down to rest underneath her favourite tree she never woke up again. The garden was perhaps the most valuable thing she left behind, and it was certainly the one she had held dearest while still alive. But her people did not share her love for nature's beauty, and all they saw was a splendid example of horticulture that could be turned into money. Soon after her death a merchant caravan came, and the strangers offered great sums for the garden and for all that belonged to it. They dug out the trees and took the fruit because they believed they could rebuild the garden in their native land. However, soon after the caravan had left the city a terrible sandstorm arose. After the storm had cleared the caravan was gone and with it all that was left of the garden.", 2821 String="So the seven were banished to the depths of seven cursed tombs. There they are waiting, imprisoned for eternity.\nOne was buried outside the city in the shadows of the south-eastern tower, close to the pharaoh yet forever banished from his grace.\nOne was buried in the ancient ruins far to the north, a tribute to her love for all that is old.\nOne was buried at the tar pits. Blackness engulfed his withering heart, and blackness shall engulf his final demise.\nOne was buried in the fields of stone. His will was as hard as a rock, so lifeless stone will cause his fall.\nOne was buried near the Mountain, between its eternal body and a small stony hill, so that his rest may be eternal and unrelenting like the mountain he loved so much.\nOne was buried somewhere on the peninsula to the south, so that his restless slumber might be soothed by the murmuring of the waves.\nOne was buried not far to the north of the oasis. He was the one who found it most difficult to part from this world.\nThe sands of the desert swallowed them all and sealed their fate.
