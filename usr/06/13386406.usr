This stones can easily be carried around and store the specific spell. It can be used at any time, and only some require further investment of mana. \nSpontaneous spells are cased in the heartbeat they are needed and take effect instantly. Most of these spells are spells of healing but some of them are agressive and some even have more astonishing effectes, as invisibility, illusionary shapechage etc.", 2816 String="Tactics handbook - Use training to your advantage. Avoid fighting more than one enemy at the same time. Be careful while chasing an enemy because you might get hurt by his allies or by other monsters and can't defend yourself while targeting him. \nTarget only the closest enemy or you'll become confused and might not be able to defend yourself against other attacks. \nDifferent enemies require different tactics. Some are better to be fought in an aggressive way; some should be fought in a defensive way. Which attack style you choose also depends on your equipment. If you wear only light armour, there is probably no point in fighting defensive and the other way around. ", 2920, 3607, 3607, 3585 Amount=1}},
