They are masters of most weapons and the shield. A skilled knight can inflict enormous damage even with the lesser weapons", 2816 String="Tactics handbook - Use training to your advantage. Avoid fighting more than one enemy at the same time. Be careful while chasing an enemy because you might get hurt by his allies or by other monsters and can't defend yourself while targeting him. \nTarget only the closest enemy or you'll become confused and might not be able to defend yourself against other attacks. \nDifferent enemies require different tactics. Some are better to be fought in an aggressive way; some should be fought in a defensive way. Which attack style you choose also depends on your equipment. If you wear only light armour, there is probably no point in fighting defensive and the other way around. ", 2816 String="The citys of the continent: \n\nFibula is a small village on an isle southwest of the mainland. Its under the rulership of the Thais monarchy. Its rumored that beneath this isle are caves and dungeons of unknown but certainly ancient origin. \n\nOn the mainland is the city of Thais, ruled by the wise and just King Tibianus. His explorers found the new soulvortex on this isle and build this base to protect and train the incoming heroes.  \n\nIn the far northwest is the city of Carlin, that is ruled by amazons. The stuborn so called queen refuses to accept the rulership of the Thais monarchy over the whole continent. \n\nAt the great bay, east of Thais lies a rotten town of criminals. Little is known about it and only the most ruthles people even think about travelling there. \n\nThe dwarfen town, north of mount sternum, the central tibian mountainmassive, is the home of the tibian dwarfs. If you are looking for smiths of unparraleled skill you should travel there. \n\nFarer north, at the northern shores you find the elven city of Ab'Dendriel. There live the elves, masters of nature and masterhunters. \n", 2816 String="The orc - The green skinned orc is intelligent and able to use weapons and armor. They are warriors of some power and very dangerous in greater numbers. We are lucky not to have encountered any of the more dangerous orcs like warriors or berserkers on this isle.\n\nThe poison spider - Roughly only slightly tougher then the ordinary spider it can poison you. Try to avoid such fate since they usually live far from our base and you might not make it to our local monk for healing.\n\nThe bug - The bug is not that dangerous. More an annoyance then a threat to an adventurer of some experience. It might become a lethal threat to a perfect rookie. With some preparation they should not be worth to bother about.\n\nThe deer - Deers are a fine supply for food and are non-agressive animals and try to flee on sight. It might be difficult to catch them and you might easily enter the territory of a local predator while chasing them. \n\nThe rotworm - A creature of decay that lives underground like its small cousin, the earthworm. Its toothed maw is a formidable weapon and rotworms have torn more then one adventurer to pieces. A horde of them might kill anyone, so great caution is advised while encountering them.\n\nOther beasts - It is certain, that other beast live in the dungeons of our isle. But they are not numerous enough to become recognized yet. If you encounter any unknown beast it is certainly dangerous and a potential lethal enemy. Don't underestimate them.\n\nThe wasp - fast and deadly to the unexperienced. Their speed makes them dangerous, even more in high numbers", 2816 String="The First Creatures BOOK TWO\n\nBrog however laughed over the dragon, which he had create, because he roamed over Tibia and was a terror to the few\nother creatures. Brog was fascinated by this created being and its terrible children, although they showed him neither loyalty nor\nrespect. Thus Brog created further life, imitiating his shape, in order to please him, and so the cyclops entered the world. \nZathroth however was angered, because he thought the cyclos stupid and awkward. Too little trouble did they spread in the\nworld, because they quarried in Tibia for metals and enjoyed to process it with fire and force. They were too few for his likes,\nbecause they hardly grew in numbers. \nThus Zathroth reprimanded his blockheaded son and ordered him to create new life. For he himself still could not understand\nthe secret of life. Under his guidance the first trolls, numerous and vexatious, developed but still without the malicious cunning,\nwhich Zathroth desired. Next father and son therefore created the orcs. And the orcs turned out just like the dark God wanted\nthem. They flowed over Tibia, spread out and began to devastate it.", 2816 String="The fauna of rookgaard. \nOne of the native trees of this isle is the rookiepine. \nThis tough tree grows almost everywhere and can withstand the common storms in the harsh winter. \nAnother tree you can find is the dwarfenoak. The smaler cousin of the tibian oak is a fast growing tree and so the most common wood supply on rookgaard as well as on the continent. \nOnly botanist can distiguisch the dwarfenoak from the strang rookguard banannatree. On rookguard there is an oaklike plat which fruits resemble Bannanas in shape and tase that much. noone can make out the difference of the fruits. To all persons without knowledge in botanology the only hint to find a bannanatree is the witheblossom flower that often seems to live in a kind of symbiosis with the cherry tree. \nThe dragontongue plant is easily spotted by its deep red blossoms and rumored to be an usefull reagent in varrious alchemical potions. \nThe swamplants re that numerous and various that we didn't have a chance for an extensive calssification. ", 2816 String="The First Creatures BOOK ONE\n\nZathroth however was delighted by the destructive potential, which Fafnar showed, and he looked upon her with delight. He\nflattered her with compliments, and he succeeded in seducing her. \nThus they conceived Brog, the fiery raging berserker. Brog possessed only little of his fathers wisdom, and the heat of his\nmother burned only deep inside of him. There however the fire became more ravaging and more hurting, and the rough titan\nraged and cried that the elements were shaken. Inexpressible pain troubled him, until the blocheaded Brog compacted his\nmagical powers and hurled a major part of the fire far away from himself. From the fire, which did not want to cool down,\nhowever immediately the first dragon, called Garsharak, rose and he bore many further lower dragons in the course of the\ncenturies from his fire and his magic, of the like we know today. ", 2816 String="The rat - I fear we brought this pest with us on the isle and they soon increased in numbers. You might encounter the rats nearly everywhere, though they prefer to live undergound. \nMostly harmless, they tend to destroy food supplies and can become dangerous in greater numbers to the bad equiped human.\n\nThe snake - The poisonous snakes hide in the woods and near the northern swamps. They usually can be found at the shores more often then in the isles centre. They are not too dangerous to a adventurer with some basic equipment. If poisoned it is a wise decision to run straight to the monk who guards the soul vortex, where everyone enters the world of Tibia, and ask for healing.\n\nThe spider - Similarly dangerous as the rat, the spiders were found by the first explorers of the isle and are native to Rookgard. They live above and beneath ground and tend to live and hunt in packs to increase their danger.\n\nThe wolf - There are some smaler wolf packs on this isle. Wolves are fast, tough and dangerous. Often they are the hunters and not the hunted on this island. It is a good decision to engage them in combat only with decent equipment and try to fight them only one on one.\n\nThe troll - Though intelligent in a limited way, the cowardish trolls are not a threat to our small outpost. They are able to create and use some basic equipment and quite tough to lesser weapons and unskilled fighters. Follow the advise to have mastered some basics in shielding, before you challenge even one of them.\n\nThe bear - Bears are hard to beat! Keep that in mind before challenging one. If you are unexperienced and have no good equipment, retreat is the tactic of choice. Best kill them in small hunting parties and use terrain to your advantage.\n"}}},
