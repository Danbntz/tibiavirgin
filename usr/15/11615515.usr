No one is able to produce it.\nNevertheless, there are hundreds, thousands of potions arround this world? Where do they come from?\nWho is interested in drunken hunters? The answer is quite obvious: The demon! Beer is an invention of the demon!\nThere is another very mysterious fluid here in Tibia. People tend to call it \"oil\".\nI really don't know what to do with it. It smells strange; if you know how to put it on fire,\nit burns quite fine (it's not easy, but once it burns it is very hot!).\nAvoid steping on a pool of oil - it's very slippery. That leads me to an idea: My watch doesn't work\nanymore since yesterday - maybe I should try to throw it in a glass filled with oil? If I succeed,\nI will write another book on this topic.\nThe last known brown fluid is \"mud\". It is a very familiar fluid; it doesn't smell, but it is dirty.\nI do not know, how this mud fits into our world, but it is just here.\nNobody knows where it came from, nobody knows its use...", 2826 String="How to mix magical potions\n\nPotion of future-vision\n\nOnce drunk, this potion allows you to see the future for some time. Since this potion is so mighty and powerful, the ingredients are very rare and therefore difficult to get.\nYou'll need at least the following things:\n2 potions of clear water\na teardrop of a demon\nfire from a dragons breath\na sting of a wasp\nsome hair of a gigantic spider\na nail of a finger of a king's child\nthe nose of a royal rat.\nThis potion is cooked in a golden pot and stired with a heroic sword. It needs to be cooked\nfor two hours and a half, and you have to cast the words \"murman thusis nalbo\" on it.\nGood luck and happy cooking!", 2824 String="How to mix magical potions\n\nPotion of flight\n\nDrink this potion and fly like a bird! All you need is listed below:\ntwo wings of a wasp\nan eye of a dead body\na rope\na potion of lemonade\na watch\nand, of course,\na rapier to stir with\nand finally a pot to cook in it.\nPut all things except the watch into the pot and cook it for 24 minutes.\nCast the spell \"flifli bor\" on it and drink it.\nDon't forget to have an eye at the time! This fluid lasts for 12 minutes.\nOnce the time is over, you are not able to fly anymore... you'll fall down like a stone.\nTherefore, never forget the time and always wear a watch when using the \"potion of flight\"!\nGood luck and may the birds be with you!", 2829 String="\"On different Fluids, 3rd publication\"\nby Arisophlus\n\nThe most common fluid is water. It's blue and opaque, you can't miss it.\nYou can drink it; usually it does not have any affections on the human body, but if the water\ncomes from a very special place it is said to have healing powers!", 2826 String="How to mix magical potions\n\nPotion of recall\n\nOnce you forgot the recipe of this potion, it's hard to remember. To remember it, you should drink this potion, which of course could cause problems if you haven't something of it left or you forgot that it was this potion.\nAll you need for this potion is:\na dead rat\n23 pieces of gold\na rose\na fishbone\na watch\na peel of a banana\nand, of course,\na rapier to stir with\nand finaly a pot to cook in.\nThrow the ingredients together into the pot and cook it for 28 minutes. After that, cast the magical words \"murana nur\" on it. Drink it, and you will gain your full memory again.\nBEWARE: This potion does not help undeads. In order to work, this spell needs a brain in the\nconcerning body. Without a brain, it's useless.\nIt also should be mentioned, that this potion only brings back one's memories for a short\nperiod of time.
