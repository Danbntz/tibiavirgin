They wove a powerful spell, the spell of the creation, in order to bind Tibiasulas essence to the\ncolumn of time. As Zathroth laughed loudly, in his vain triumph, he did not understand their words, and so the secret of creation\nand life stayed hidden from him forever. \nThey however wove the fleeting elements to powerful strands. Althought they did not succeed in uniting them again but the\nindividual parts became something new, the first real creation. \nThus the living part became Tibia, born from the element earth, Sula became the sea washing around it. Air rose over the\ncreation and layed itself like a protecting blanket over the creation, and the fire seeped under it and began to warm it up. \nBehold: Each of the separate parts of the god was full of life and divinity! But none of the elements possessed the spirit of the\nTibiasula, but they were wild and impetuous, following always the impulses which corresponded to their nature. ", 3561, 3561}},

Tibia was completely scattered with the corpses of the great battle,\nand all life threatened to be suffocated thereby. \nThere the gods decided that Uman should unite with the earth in order to create a godly being, which would take care of the\ndead. But Zathroth used a deception and appeared to the earth as its other side, Uman, and conceived in his place a being.\nThis was the birth of Urgith, the master of the undead. \nAnd immediately the dead ones began to raise themselves on his calling, and they all were his creatures. Like the orcs before\nthem, now the undead covered the body of the mother Tibia, and his children, the rats, were Urgith's messengers and scouts. \nThen however Uman and Tibia united, as it had been agreed upon, and Toth was born. Toth became the guardian of the\ndead ones and sent his large worms which began to devour the undead. For a long time the struggle lasted and again no end\nwas to be foreseen. "},
