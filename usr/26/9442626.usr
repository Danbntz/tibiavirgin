The astral patterns wax and wane like the tides, and it is not possible to perform certain summonings on inappropriate days, to give but one example. The study of astrology is pointing at further influences that go well beyond summoning creatures, though. For instance, the influence of the stars and the suns seems to increase with the power level of the performed incantation or ritual. The more mana is used in a spell the more it is susceptible to extratibian influence. For this reason it seems quite safe to assume that certain powerful rituals are only possible when the stars are correctly aligned. We consequently hope to achieve through close observation and through careful calculation a measure of exactness concerning the right timing of rituals which we did not dare dream of so far. Several magic incantations we have never managed to reproduce until now might actually be achieved once we know the ideal stellar constellations. This would explain why all our previous attempts to achieve these effects were doomed to fail.", 2828 String="The secret of the high mask of the ancients was thought to be lost in time forever. But with the coming of the undying pharaoh its secrets were snatched away from the scarabs and the sands. Once more, masks were forged that contained the secret energies of lost aeons. Their true powers remained a mystery, but from the little that showed at first glance it was clear that they were most powerful indeed. Unfortunately, the pharaoh decreed that their powers were not meant for ordinary mortals, and ordered them to be destroyed.
