Nobody knows where they came\nfrom or whether they always have existed and just awaked from the deep slumber of the infinity. \nFardos fulfilled by the need to create and give birth. He stepped into existence and began immediately with the act of the\ncreation, because he was fully creative power and impatient. His godly powers emerged from him and created, formed. \nBut all his works slipped out of his hands as the void was everywhere. No single work was to last. Everything that he\ndevised dissolved in the void even before it was completed. \nUman Zathroth regarded his undertakings thoughtfully, because Uman Zathroth was wise and fullfilled with magic\npowers and insatiable hunger for knowledge, comprehension and enlightenment. He was a creature similar and nevertheless\ndifferent to the clear working of the Fardos, because mysteries and secrets were the aspects of his being. Uman and Zathroth\nwere two entities and nevertheless one. Uman was the light, bright aspect of the magic strength. His was the gift to work benign\nwonders. Zathroth however, his different - dark - side, was corruptive urge, the vain self purpose of magic, destructive and a\ndesecration! This entity, which was two and one nevertheless, observed now the works of his companion in infinity. "}}
