Nobody knows where they came\nfrom or whether they always have existed and just awaked from the deep slumber of the infinity. \nFardos fulfilled by the need to create and give birth. He stepped into existence and began immediately with the act of the\ncreation, because he was fully creative power and impatient. His godly powers emerged from him and created, formed. \nBut all his works slipped out of his hands as the void was everywhere. No single work was to last. Everything that he\ndevised dissolved in the void even before it was completed. \nUman Zathroth regarded his undertakings thoughtfully, because Uman Zathroth was wise and fullfilled with magic\npowers and insatiable hunger for knowledge, comprehension and enlightenment. He was a creature similar and nevertheless\ndifferent to the clear working of the Fardos, because mysteries and secrets were the aspects of his being. Uman and Zathroth\nwere two entities and nevertheless one. Uman was the light, bright aspect of the magic strength. His was the gift to work benign\nwonders. Zathroth however, his different - dark - side, was corruptive urge, the vain self purpose of magic, destructive and a\ndesecration! This entity, which was two and one nevertheless, observed now the works of his companion in infinity. ", 2816 String="The Creation of Humans BOOK ONE\n\nThere the Gods created the first human, Banor, the godly warrior! This entity was filled by the godly power and was full of\ncourage and responsibility. After his image and with parts of his body the Gods created him attendants, Humans. \nNobody knows, which Gods brought their powers into the recent creation, and some say that Zathroth spoiled also this\ncreation. Yes, some even state that the good Gods created a twin for Banor, which should embody the powers of magic,\nwhose raw form however was stolen by Zathroth, and he had manufactured from it the first daemonic lords to lead his\nattendants from hell. \nWhichever it might be, in any case the humans took on the fight against the crowds of the undead and probably against the\ndragons, orcs and their unholy attendants, too, and Banor was a glorious leader for mankind. ", 2816 String="The Birth of the Elements BOOK ONE\n\nSchocked Uman and Fardos tried to grab hold of the dispersing being of Tibiasula, but it was about to slip out of their hands\nlike their creations before. They wove a powerful spell, the spell of the creation, in order to bind Tibiasulas essence to the\ncolumn of time. As Zathroth laughed loudly, in his vain triumph, he did not understand their words, and so the secret of creation\nand life stayed hidden from him forever. \nThey however wove the fleeting elements to powerful strands. Althought they did not succeed in uniting them again but the\nindividual parts became something new, the first real creation. \nThus the living part became Tibia, born from the element earth, Sula became the sea washing around it. Air rose over the\ncreation and layed itself like a protecting blanket over the creation, and the fire seeped under it and began to warm it up. \nBehold: Each of the separate parts of the god was full of life and divinity! But none of the elements possessed the spirit of the\nTibiasula, but they were wild and impetuous, following always the impulses which corresponded to their nature. ", 2920, 3588 Amount=10}},
