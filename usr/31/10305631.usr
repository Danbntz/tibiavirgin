But with the coming of the undying pharaoh its secrets were snatched away from the scarabs and the sands. Once more, masks were forged that contained the secret energies of lost aeons. Their true powers remained a mystery, but from the little that showed at first glance it was clear that they were most powerful indeed. Unfortunately, the pharaoh decreed that their powers were not meant for ordinary mortals, and ordered them to be destroyed.

It is there that our praised pharaoh resides, surrounded by his trusted servants. Far below the palace, hidden in the deepest dungeons of the ancient pyramid are the tombs of despair. The old pharaoh met his fate there, and it is said he still roams the hidden passageways, bound forever to his undead body. So great was the wisdom of Arkhothep that he granted his father eternal unlife, so that he may to atone for his sins and become worthy of ascension. Who knows? Perhaps one day he, too, will ascend, leaving both the curse and his tomb behind him and taking his place at Arkhothep's side. But I fear his folly defies all attempt to cure it.

They appear to be nothing but mere blurs in the sand, and those who are unfortunate enough to see them believe their eyes just played tricks on them. But then, the Larokhon are rarely ever seen by mortals since they shun daylight. They prefer those twilight moments when there is still some warmth left from a scorching day although night has clearly fallen. This is the time when the Larokhons' move from their secret hideouts to prey on unwary dreamers that are haunted by nightmares. Their sense of smelling fear is infallible, and once they have found their prey a mere crack in a wall is large enough for them to enter. Once they are close to their victims they feast on their innermost fears, evoking images of horror and despair that are so horrible that they often cause the dreamer's death.

And Arkhothep forged the parts of a powerful mask and assembled it on a demon altar. He had secretly erected this unholy shrine underneath the great pyramid he had planned to use as the final resting place for his father. So strong was this altar's magic that it fused the parts to form the famous Helmet of the Ancients as soon as they were placed on it. Eight helmets Arkhothep crafted, one for himself and one for each of his allies. But he did not fully trust his fellow conspirators, so he inserted ordinary rubies into their helmets, while his own helmet was imbued with the eternal power of a soul ruby. This way those helmets had only a fraction of his own helmet's powers. But Arkhothep's precautions against his allies went further than that. He only revealed the secret to forge one single part of the helmet to each of them, and each of them was taught the secret to forge a  different part. Arkhothep clearly saw through his allies' greedy natures. He knew they would never share their knowledge with each other, and he foresaw that their greed would make them plot against each other rather than against him.", 2832 String="Mehrah asram cha mehe than.

However, we are still convinced that in theory it must be capable of divulging additional information such as the experience and power of the targeted persons as well as their general physical condition and the chemical composition of their last supper. There are numerous problems, though, and it is well possible that we have to start all over again. This would mean, of course, that we would have to create some spells to obtain information by means of magic which is plain to see when you are close to the targeted person. One might argue that it is a waste of time and resources to develop such a spell, but then I see no other way to create a similar spell that features enhanced range and a combination of effects.", 2820 String="Researchpaper 35-22 D\nThe 'Foeburner' spell still is not working. Somehow it seems impossible to specify a group of targets to be excluded from the area of the spell effect. If only we found a way to use a spell or a spell-like ability to define non-target groups we could finally make the spell work. For now, however, we have stopped the research because we felt it is necessary to create the groundwork for future research in the field. The question is: Should we focus on working out a special definition spell, or is it actually possible to weave some sort of divination spell into the pattern of the foeburner in order to receive a satisfying result with a single spell. I am somewhat inclined towards the latter option because of the satisfactory results we have recently achieved in the field of divination magic.", 2826 String="The lamp of Tazur was made of finest gold by the most skilled goldsmith of the land. He bound one of the mightiest and most evil djinn into it. The djinn was forced to do his every bidding. Using his power the artisan defeated legions of enemies. He even travelled to distant Drefia which in those days was at the zenith of its glory, and he met many necromancers who were willing to share their knowledge with him. This way he became even more powerful. Using stolen lifeforce he lived longer than any man was meant to live, and with his own eyes he saw the might of his necromancer allies decline. Legend has it that one day the djinn of good decided to stop the outrageous cabals of Drefia. Other stories say that it was in fact the evil djinn who saw their power threatened by it. Whatever the true cause might be, one night a star fell down from the sky and smashed most of Drefia, breaking its evil power forever, and the goldsmith finally met his fate. His most prized treasure, the lamp of Tazur was lost that night. It is said that it is still there somewhere, hidden on the ocean bed, waiting for a new owner.", 2816 String="The lost garden\nPrincess Maharuh was said to be the kindest creature that ever walked the earth. She was dearly loved both by her people and by the djinns. One day as the princess wept because of all the pain and the evil ways of the world the djinns came to comfort her. And since they loved her so much they called upon their powers to grow a garden of magnificent beauty. From now on, Maharuh visited her enchanted garden whenever she was sad, and she never went there but a smile came to her face, and she found new strength to continue her work with renewed vigour and inspiration. But humans grow old and weary, and time did not fail to do its cruel work on fair Princess Maharuh. As she grew old her visits to the garden became less and less frequent and one day when she laid down to rest underneath her favourite tree she never woke up again. The garden was perhaps the most valuable thing she left behind, and it was certainly the one she had held dearest while still alive. But her people did not share her love for nature's beauty, and all they saw was a splendid example of horticulture that could be turned into money. Soon after her death a merchant caravan came, and the strangers offered great sums for the garden and for all that belonged to it. They dug out the trees and took the fruit because they believed they could rebuild the garden in their native land. However, soon after the caravan had left the city a terrible sandstorm arose. After the storm had cleared the caravan was gone and with it all that was left of the garden.", 2820 String="Researchpaper 56-09 A\nWe lost three mages in our last attempt at performing a controlled demon summoning. It is still too difficult to predict in what way the fabric of time and space is affected by the breach of the sphere, and from what we have seen the backlash of nature against demonic incursion can range from a slightly offensive odour to a sizeable explosion such as the one we saw yesterday. I am personally disappointed to observe that the elemental protection spells we put up did not work at all. Perhaps there is some truth in the reports that the unleashed energy is of purely entropical nature. We have yet to decide whether or not it makes sense to create an entropic counterspell first, but I support the idea that the loss of manpower while trying to balance the spell is manageable. It is possible, though, that this will lead to no convincing result at all due to the uncontrollable nature of the demonic realm. If this should be the case the use of entropic countermagic is the only option left.\nBy the way: The summoning of lesser creatures, the so-called 'reds', progressed comparatively well. Of course, these creature are mere borderdwellers and may consequently not be considered true demons of course. However, it may prove that the development of summoning spells for 'reds' will prove a rewarding spin-off of demon summoning research.", 2829 String="Suns and Stars, Part I\nIt stands to reason that the stars and the suns influence the flow of magic. The astral patterns wax and wane like the tides, and it is not possible to perform certain summonings on inappropriate days, to give but one example. The study of astrology is pointing at further influences that go well beyond summoning creatures, though. For instance, the influence of the stars and the suns seems to increase with the power level of the performed incantation or ritual. The more mana is used in a spell the more it is susceptible to extratibian influence. For this reason it seems quite safe to assume that certain powerful rituals are only possible when the stars are correctly aligned. We consequently hope to achieve through close observation and through careful calculation a measure of exactness concerning the right timing of rituals which we did not dare dream of so far. Several magic incantations we have never managed to reproduce until now might actually be achieved once we know the ideal stellar constellations. This would explain why all our previous attempts to achieve these effects were doomed to fail.", 2829 String="Suns and Stars, Part II\nVery basic rituals depend on the influences of dawn and dusk, or of night and day. Other, more complex rituals may only be performed at very specific times, perhaps even at a specific hour. Other rituals that are more complex still are bound to specific days, and to specific times as well. In fact, some individual spells can only be performed once a year or once every other year, while the most powerful of rituals may only be carried out during stellar constellations that are so incredibly rare that centuries may pass before the ritual can be performed again. Given the power and knowledge of the ancients it seems reasonable to assume that they have prepared rituals whose time has not even come to this very day. Since most of the ancient races have disappeared from the lands it is well possible that some of the rituals are still be buried in some long forgotten ruin, while others might actually be in the possession of some surviving heir of one of the ancient races.\nWho knows. The astrological knowledge of the ancients is yet to be rediscovered. We are perfectly positive that some of the discoveries we have made can be considered as the groundwork for further, more elaborate theories which one day might rival that of the ancients. Still, it would be an immense progress if we could rediscover some of the ancients' lost astrological writings.", 2816 String="Ancient mummies are fiends of horrendous powers. Only the bravest warriors dare to challenge them, and most of these fools join the ranks of the mummie's undead legions all too soon. In life, each of these ancient horrors was a champion in his own right, but now that they have entered the dreadful state of undeath they have become truly formidable, for there is no way to kill them for good. No matter how hard they are hit the ancient powers bound to their mummified bodies will always make them rise again in all their horrifying glory to take revenge on the living.", 2820 String="Researchpaper 33-16 H\nThe 'stoneskin' spell is still flawed. The test subjects complained about severe problems when moving, and some actually suffered from partial paralysis or even from acute petrification! However, I still believe the spell might be useful as some sort of emergency measure because I imagine that turning oneself into a statue for a while might come in handy when all other options have failed. Oddly enough it is quite simple to focus the spell into an object, preferably an amulet, so the change is still bound to an object that serves as a transmitter. Obviously the problem is related to the one we had when we tried to channel certain spells through runes. I'm afraid that while research covering spontaneous magic has made great advances since the early days we are still at the beginning when it comes to channelled spells."}}, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 2854 Content={2854}, 3313, 2853, 3421, 2870 Content={3267, 3412, 3421, 2868 Content={2868 Content={3503 Content={3507 String="luffia" Editor="Mamo en Zanera"}}}, 3310, 3310, 3310, 3310, 3310}}, 2857 Content={2906, 4871, 2872 Content={3084 RemainingUses=250, 3042 Amount=2, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 3059}, 4839}}, 2473 Content={2472 Content={2469, 2991}}, 2857 Content={2835 String="Hunted stupid bitch,\nI kill you.\n\n                      Rafmex" Editor="Rafmex", 3505 String="ula  soy bea\nmira aki t paso lo q cogi cuando moriste\nno esta todo \nsolo lo q le sake al tio q t kito las cosas\n200gp\n:S\nxauu bb tkm\nbesikos", 2815}, 2955, 2955, 2955}, 3483}}, 3551, 3552}, 3077, 3054 RemainingUses=200, 2969 KeyNumber=3033, 2970 KeyNumber=3800, 2970 KeyNumber=3801, 2970 KeyNumber=4503, 2969 KeyNumber=4603, 2969 KeyNumber=4600, 2970 KeyNumber=4601, 2969 KeyNumber=4603, 2970 KeyNumber=4503, 2969 KeyNumber=3033, 2969 KeyNumber=4600}, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3406, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 2393, 3572, 3054 RemainingUses=200, 3008, 3045 RemainingUses=200, 3061, 3740 Amount=1, 3045 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3012, 3046 SavedExpireTime=30}}, 3338, 3299, 3308}, 2853, 3587 Amount=23, 3589 Amount=13, 3725 Amount=1, 3586 Amount=39, 3587 Amount=1}, 3449 Amount=2, 2854, 3046 SavedExpireTime=2999, 3456, 3449 Amount=100, 2853, 2992 Amount=16, 3469, 2991, 2853 Content={3412, 3337}}, 3003, 3003, 3003, 3465}, 2868 Content={3003, 2868}, 3507 String="miromaen kayokalfos\ncarlin" Editor="Mamo en Zanera"}, 3504 Content={2867 Content={3330, 3264, 2854 Content={3586 Amount=11, 3591 Amount=20, 3587 Amount=5, 3584 Amount=10, 3290}}, 3504 Content={2854 Content={3563, 2868 Content={2870 Content={2859 Content={2957, 3576}, 2871 Content={2868 Content={2868 Content={2854 Content={2854 Content={2868 Content={2854 Content={2853 Content={2955, 3188 Charges=2, 3188 Charges=3, 3188 Charges=3, 3174 Charges=5, 3174 Charges=5, 3578 Amount=3, 3483}, 2860}, 2854, 2854}, 3504 Content={3504 Content={3504 Content={3504 Content={3504 Content={3504 Content={3504 Content={3504 Content={3504 Content={2853 Content={2868, 2969 KeyNumber=3033, 2920, 3308, 2853 Content={3207 Amount=1}, 2853 Content={3012, 2906, 3008, 3551, 3097}}, 2854 Content={3273}, 2920 SavedExpireTime=594, 2853 Content={2854 Content={3457, 3003, 3316, 3003, 3457, 3316}, 3308, 3465, 3465}, 2853 Content={3465, 2873, 2874, 2874}}, 2853 Content={3504 Content={3504 Content={2867 Content={2854}, 2853 Content={2854 Content={2839 String="Hoy gran peda en el salon de peleas de thais a las 8 pm no llegen tarde por ke  el chupe se akava.......", 2825 String="20 Tricks to Get People's Money\n\n...", 2826 String="Tales of Tibia"}}, 2853}, 3504 Content={3003, 2821 String="<you recognize a torn diary of some sort>\n...
