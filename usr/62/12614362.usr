Therefore Suon also rose up in order to stop his sister. A wild struggle started and pretty soon it turned out that Suon\nwas the stronger one of the two. So Fafnar fled under Tibia into the parental fire, but Suon wanted his sister to promise him\nnever to scorch the other elements again.

She escaped on the\nother side and again rose over all elements, and began anew, to scorch these. When Suon followed her now, in order to punish\nher, she didn't let it come not a further test of strength and escaped the brother immediately. He followed the teasing and\naggravating sister tirelessly into the embrace of the fire. But Fafnar was a step ahead of him and had already fled again onto the\nother side over the elements ... and in such a way this continues to go on even today. \nUman united himself with the earth, which we know as Tibia.

Even Zathroth was fascinated by the idea of his other half and\ncontributed a tiny proportion of his strength to the effort. The wise claim that it is to be due to his working that all time strives in\nthe long run to decay and destruction. \nThe powers of the godly bundled themselves to an enormous power greater than any in existence before. It began to\ncrystallize itself in the void to an enormous spiral. Higher and higher it mounted up, became firmness, pivot point, direction and\naim of existence!
