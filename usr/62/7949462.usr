If so, nothing is known about the father of this child. Considering that Goshnar was allied with darkness we must fear the worst. So the search for Fermuba continues.", 2821 String="For our deeds for king and country the king granted our order the eastern lands. The city under our protectorate is growing and will soon be as big and as beautifull as our capital. But there is much work to do and countless monsters to slay to bring peace to the green planes. Some days ago Falnus vanished and we have to accept that he is dead, probably murdered by the brotherhood. Of course even a mage of his power could also be slain by a greater number of creatures as dangerous as giant spiders, that still roam this plains. Its a hard blow to our researches in the arts of healing and recreations and the loss of a great man.", 2816 String="The dreamchallenge is far to easy, all riddles can by solved, by thinking, simple watching,  and knowledge of our ways. The coclave decided to add some real dangers to the test to make it a real challenge. The major problem by now is the Circle o.L. since it often requires a quest for the candidates but that will change soon if the monsters are added as the conclave decided. I guess the knights who cried for this kind of challange will get more then they bargained for. ", 2816 String="At last we trapped Hugo in the dungeoncellars! \nThe beast killed two dozend of our members in \nthe wild chase. \nAtfer a painfull and long hunt our mages occupied Hugo with some summoned dragons that distracted him long enough to prepare the trap. As Hugo followed the 'track' we laid for him our druids trapped him with plantbarriers and moved the earth around him. Now the beast is trapped and may Fardos, Uman and Banor give that we can keep him satiated and harmless, using the trick the druids figured out. Our aspirants will have a hard time to pass the test of Hugo, that was created around that beast. ", 2816 String="The weapons trainer is not pleased with the progress of the mages. The bodys of the sorcerors and druids are not trained enough to stand his lessons as long as they should to improve adaequately. On the other hand the Knights and the Paladins adopt to the ways of magic too slowly to see any progress above a certain given point. So we will stick to the concept of the four ways and drop the idea of the warriormages for now. Perhaps in the future we might find another way to combine the skills of arms and magic in some way.
