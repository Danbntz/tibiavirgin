The world was fragile, the boundaries between the worlds cracked by the enormous powers, which had been\nemployed. Already the armies of the older races were readying themselves to recapture from the humans what the old ones\nregarded as theirs. Already the children of the darkness, hardly troubled by the undead, risen again to new powers, were\nwaiting to spread chaos over the world. Already the dragons sharpened their talons on their rock, in order to rise again into air\nto devastate the world in a fiery nightmare. Already the victorious armies of humans threw possessive looks on new targets.\nAlready the daemons hammered on the walls of their breakable prison.

You will find dungeons somewhere in the wilderness.\nDon't enter dungeons without equipment. Especially a rope and a shovel will prove valuable. Make sure you have a supply of torches with you, while wandering into the unknown. \nIt's wise to travel the dungeons in groups and not alone. For more help read all the books of the academy before you begin exploring. \nTraveling in the dungeons will reward the cautious and brave, but punish the reckless.\n", 2816 String="Tibia's Renewal BOOK TWO\n\nThere the Gods on both sides stopped. They looked down upon the desintegrating world, and they decided an armistice,\nbecause they all wanted power over the creation, not its complete destruction. Thus the Gods threw the charm of the new\nbeginning over the world! Only gradually the recovering sections of the old world started to rise from the nebulas of time,\nawakened the old races and old frights back to life. It is said that the city of Tibia was the first to rise again, barren of almost all\nlife, without all magic, on a tiny island, deserted and almost devoid of life ... and nevertheless full of age-old secrets. And soon\nafterwards life returned to the world. \nAlso via the portal of souls old and new heroes found their way to Tibia. Gradually larger sections of the old world emerged\nfrom the nebulas, further natures and miracles. But the world is still far from its former splendour and size, and we live in times\nof change. What today is still natural, may as soon as tomorrow be only a legend, what today is still fantasy, may already\ntomorrow be reality. \nBut hear ye and listen: Bad spirits also arrived and still arrive by the portal in our realm, in order to do mischief in human\nshape.
