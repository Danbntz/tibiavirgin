Thus she gave them pus from her\nfestering face wounds as dangerous poison. But too bad! Still the bad orcs, equipped with cyclop weapons, were too powerful\nand too malicious. \nBut when the Orks threatened to cover Tibia almost completely, the dragon came! They had decided that only they\nthemselves were to be the true and absolute rulers of Tibia. They did know no mercy in their rage! With fire and magic\nthey annihilated the orcs, devastated their cities and drove them into the underworld. Even the cyclops, which hurried\nfuriously to the battle, and auxiliary troops from enslaved trolls were no match against the fiery anger of the dragons. Enormous\ncyclopic cities were laid into ruins, unbelievable forging factories were lost for all eternity, and until today the cyclops are upset\nabout the orcs because of these losses.
