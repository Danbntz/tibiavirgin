This entity was filled by the godly power and was full of\ncourage and responsibility. After his image and with parts of his body the Gods created him attendants, Humans. \nNobody knows, which Gods brought their powers into the recent creation, and some say that Zathroth spoiled also this\ncreation. Yes, some even state that the good Gods created a twin for Banor, which should embody the powers of magic,\nwhose raw form however was stolen by Zathroth, and he had manufactured from it the first daemonic lords to lead his\nattendants from hell. \nWhichever it might be, in any case the humans took on the fight against the crowds of the undead and probably against the\ndragons, orcs and their unholy attendants, too, and Banor was a glorious leader for mankind.

Nornur envied the brother Crunor because of his\nshape, as he was hardly more than wind and nebulae, and he asked he brother for assistance in creating a shape for him. But no\nmatter how hard the brothers tried, Nornur couldn't appear to be much more than a shadow of a ghost. \nThus Nornur decided to create creatures in order to reveal himself. Thus the spiders came into the world, which are able to\nweb their ghostlike spiderwebs, which copy Nornurs shape, and thus praise and honor him. \nAlso Uman and Sula, the sea, found together, and they conceived Bastesh, the unfathomable one. She was exceedingly\nbeautiful, and the Godly were astonished. But Fafnar, the sun, looked upon all this beauty full of envy! When the newly born\nBastesh looked up to her, she attacked her with fiery claws in the face and scratched it dreadfully. Probably Bastesh would not\nhave survived the attack of her sister, had not the other Gods hurriedly come to help and driven away the ravishing Fafnar. \nBastesh however was frightened and disfigured. Full of fear she fled into the embrace of her mother Sula. In the depths of the\nseas the unfathomable one hides herself since that time, and little is known about her and her workings. Only the fact that the\nsea has been populated since that time by numerous creatures, may tell us that Bastesh seems to create these in the depth. In\naddition it is said that since that time the water of the seas is salty from the tears, which the disfigured Bastesh sheds out of\nanguish and pain.", 2816 String="The sorcerer: \nSorcerers are masters of magic.

And as the\ndivinity was weakened by the creation and without suspicion and resistance, the deadly attack penetrated to the core of her\nbeing and destroyed her. \nThe elements - fires, water, earth and air - were jerked out of their harmony and landed at the base of the column of time.", 2816 String="The citys of the continent: \n\nFibula is a small village on an isle southwest of the mainland.
