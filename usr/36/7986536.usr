I am in a really shitty mood. I feel like shit, Bob and Terron are bein assholes, and i miss you. You always have something nice to say to me no matter how much of an airhead i am. I love you. I know we had that talk today and it really makes a lot of sense. But my feelings are so strong that i don't know how to deal with them. My god you are 1300 miles away and my arms just don't reach that far to hug you. Wish they did though. lol. I wonder if there is a limit to how much you can write on one of these letters. I guess i'll find out. I am trying really hard to find a picture of me that i like. I don't like my pictures or any that have me in it. I feel so ugly all the time. Oh well. YOu know whats funny? There was a guy that i really liked and i still do. I met him about 10 years ago. His name is Brian. I never would go out with him because at the time he was 18 and i was 29. But now that he's 28 and i'm 39 there doesn't seem to be that much of an age difference. But i'm married and he has a girlfriend. I won't leave bobby for him because i know he will never leave his girlfriend. And the reason he won't is because she supports him. He drives HER new truck. He tells me he loves me but i know better. If he did he would try to be with me. I don't feel that way about you. I have never felt that you were bullshittin me. I do wonder though if there is anyone else that you talk to on this game. You know like you talkto me. I wondered about that girl Jinha or however you spell it. But you talked in front of her like you do in provate so I am not worried. Do you think I'm crazy feeling like this? Oh well. Just to let ya know, Brian and i are good friends and he and his girlfriend come out here occassionally. Well baby i've written a book on here it seems like. \nHello again. I am talking to you in person now, well in computer person now. I like that much better than letters. well i'll send this to ya and talk to you later.
