He bound one of the mightiest and most evil djinn into it. The djinn was forced to do his every bidding. Using his power the artisan defeated legions of enemies. He even travelled to distant Drefia which in those days was at the zenith of its glory, and he met many necromancers who were willing to share their knowledge with him. This way he became even more powerful. Using stolen lifeforce he lived longer than any man was meant to live, and with his own eyes he saw the might of his necromancer allies decline. Legend has it that one day the djinn of good decided to stop the outrageous cabals of Drefia. Other stories say that it was in fact the evil djinn who saw their power threatened by it. Whatever the true cause might be, one night a star fell down from the sky and smashed most of Drefia, breaking its evil power forever, and the goldsmith finally met his fate. His most prized treasure, the lamp of Tazur was lost that night. It is said that it is still there somewhere, hidden on the ocean bed, waiting for a new owner.", 2827 String="Cursed be the Akh, for it diverts our attention to things that are but trivial and transitory! Too many fail in their quests for ascension because they give in to their akhs' temptations. If only they knew that ascension holds the key to all our grievances! Only by ascending can we redeem the akh from its mortal bounds and free the Rah and the Uthun to strive for divinity. For each mortal creature holds the key to divinity, to be a god of his own right. \nUnfortunately, the so-called gods are jealous. They do not want the mortals to take what they think is rightfully theirs. It is because of this that they have instructed their followers to condemn the sacred state which they call undead. Brothers and sisters, unite! See through the deceptions of the akh! Shed your mortal shells and embrace the death-that-is-not-death! Ascend and be reborn!", 2816 String="In ancient tombs beneath the burning endless sands\n\nWhere neither sunlight reaches nor the pale-faced moon\n\nThe whispers of the long deceased traitors dance\nBloodthirsty creatures screeching an unholy tune\n\nDark are the mysteries surrounded by doomed cries\n\nUncurtained to the warriors of righteous mind\n\nWho well-prepared with magic, sharpened blade and eyes\n\nStep through the doors and leave their mortal fear behind.", 2828 String="The secret of the high mask of the ancients was thought to be lost in time forever. But with the coming of the undying pharaoh its secrets were snatched away from the scarabs and the sands. Once more, masks were forged that contained the secret energies of lost aeons. Their true powers remained a mystery, but from the little that showed at first glance it was clear that they were most powerful indeed. Unfortunately, the pharaoh decreed that their powers were not meant for ordinary mortals, and ordered them to be destroyed. It is said that it was necessary to combine the powers of different ancient idols in order to create those legendary artifacts."}}}
