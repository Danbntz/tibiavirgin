It is always its first victim, the first to fall for its pathetic needs and its badly-chosen priorities. And so the Uthun falls prey to the Akh's temptations. Once the Uthun is tainted the Akh is sure to come next. The Akh is inadequately translated as 'soul' into this language. It is the unseen spiritual centre hidden deep in all that is alive, and it is each living creature's most prized possession. It is the very essence of being. And it is our most vulnerable part.", 2828 String="Rahmen Tah and the Vizier, Part I\nIn the second year of the reign of pharaoh Rahmen Tah there was a vizier who was said to consort with demons and to tamper with the powers of oblivion. He lived in a majestic tower that stood on a little island close the harbour. It was a marvel to behold, made of black glass and gold, and everybody who looked at it was filled with an eerie sense of foreboding. The vizier was rumoured to be so powerful that no one dared to bring him to justice. Even Rahmen Tah himself feared the power of his vizier, and he did not dare to send troops against the vizier. Finally he called for his chief astrologer and mathematician, the wise Athem, and asked him for advice. Athem listened quietly to the words of his pharaoh. After he had finished Athem ask his pharaoh for some time to think everything over. Reluctantly the pharaoh agreed.", 2828 String="Rahmen Tah and the Vizier, Part II\nAfter a week had passed the mathematician returned. His advice was this: The pharaoh should order a huge celebration to be held, and all pyramids should be adorned with flowers and flags. The pharaoh who trusted in the wisdom of his advisor ordered his people to prepare for the celebration. While the people did as their pharaoh had ordered them to do Athem began to build a huge wooden machine on top of the royal pyramid. No one took much notice of it because of the preparations that were going on. On the fourth day when the celebration was scheduled to start the pharaoh sent an invitation to his vizier and asked him to join in their festivity. As Athem had foreseen the vizier declined because he suspected that there was a trap. Instead he sat in the observatory at the top of his tower and watched the city because he wanted to find out what the pharaoh was up to. Too late did he understand that the construct on top of the pyramid was in fact an enormous catapult. Suddenly a huge boulder was hurled in his direction. The shot had been perfectly calculated, and it hit its mark with amazing precision. The top of the dark tower shattered and the evil vizier was crushed underneath tons of basalt. His death caused the dark magic to disappear, and the tower sank into the ocean forever.", 2827 String="Will the world never learn?\nThat pompous coxcomb of an ambassador dared to speak as though his king was equal to our pharaoh! We were shocked by the sheer impertinence of his speech! The fool! How confused he looked when he realised our disapproving silence. I am convinced he had spoken to some of those filthy heretics before he went to see his majesty. I know there are some although none of them would dare to make his blasphemous opinions known in the public. How could the mighty pharaoh not ignore this ambitious fool and his futile plans. How haughtily he walked around in our beautiful Ankrahmun, mocking our true religion with his silly questions. Of course, he got nowhere and he seemed to give up in the end. But did the wisdom offered to him enlighten his blind soul? I think not. So full of himself was he, so firm in his heretic opinions and yet such a slave to his flesh - how could he understand that which is true and holy? People like him are both a curse and a blessing to us, the children of enlightenment. They may insult and provoke us with their ignorance, yet it is when we meet fools like him that we realise the full extent of the glorious state of enlightenment we live in. Far from ascension though we are, we have been granted the opportunity to achieve what will be forever denied to people like him - divinity!", 2827 String="The master of the games asked for 'greater challenges'. I cannot help the feeling that the fool is talking about djinns and demons. However, as long as I am chief advisor of the pharaoh this will not happen. If such a creature broke loose in the city, chaos would ensue. It would be a massacre. And I am convinced that certain elements would welcome such a 'misfortune' and even work towards it.", 2827 String="Cursed be the Akh, for it diverts our attention to things that are but trivial and transitory! Too many fail in their quests for ascension because they give in to their akhs' temptations. If only they knew that ascension holds the key to all our grievances! Only by ascending can we redeem the akh from its mortal bounds and free the Rah and the Uthun to strive for divinity. For each mortal creature holds the key to divinity, to be a god of his own right. \nUnfortunately, the so-called gods are jealous. They do not want the mortals to take what they think is rightfully theirs. It is because of this that they have instructed their followers to condemn the sacred state which they call undead. Brothers and sisters, unite! See through the deceptions of the akh! Shed your mortal shells and embrace the death-that-is-not-death! Ascend and be reborn!", 2827 String="The Akh'rah Uthun is the unity of that which cannot be united. The flawed Akh, which is our anchor to this mundane world, is generally weak. By giving in to the needs of the physical Akh, the Rah and the Uthun become enslaved to this world, even though their potential is such that they could transcend the physical world. However, the greatest flaw the Akh suffers from is its mortality. Why should we seek to satisfy its puny needs and its trivial urges if we know it is doomed to die? Yet this is how the Akh holds our spirit captive. It slowly poisons both the Rah as well as the Uthun.", 2826 String="The tibian world-wonders!\nThe known and aknowledged world-wonders are:\nThe colossus of Kazordoon\nThe black pyramid of Dracoria\nThe great lighthousetree of Ab'dendriel\nThe thorntower of Shadowthorn\nThe undergroundcity of Mintwalin\nThe black city of skulls in hellsgate\nThe great lava falls in hellsgate\nThe pyramid city of Ankrahmun", 2824 String="Since the contamination of the water reservoirs became more and more of an issue, Pharaoh Unklath ordered that the position of the right honourable excreminator should be founded.
