Minotaurs fought against Minotaurs - brothers against brothers - sisters against sisters. Palkar and his knights nearly won. But me and some others were able to defeat him. Now, he and his men are outcasts.\n\nDay of sorrow.\n\nThe outcasts stole the key to our secret laboratory! That is worst of all. Now we can´t make our milk, the source of our power.\n\nI managed to bring a dragon from the dragon-pit at the outer entrance of our secret lab to guard it. He hurt me very hard. I needed much more power than I had. I am deadly injured. I hope this coughing will have an end.\n\nThe orcs and trolls conquered some caves back. Dammit! We are to weak now. We can´t defend ourselves. And my coughing gets worse and worse.\n\nSome of my men blocked the way from the secret lab to my chambers with a big rock. I think we are save now.\n\nThe outcasts made an alliance with a tribe of cyclops. Now our former brothers are our worst enemies.
