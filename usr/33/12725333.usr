To understand the concept of time is to understand the cruel trick the gods played on all mortals. Just because it pleased them to do so they stripped all living creatures of their immortality, thus turning anything they hope to achieve into futile ambition. For what is left to hope for if you know the sands of time are moving relentlessly in your hourglass, and that death will be the end of all?

It is always its first victim, the first to fall for its pathetic needs and its badly-chosen priorities. And so the Uthun falls prey to the Akh's temptations. Once the Uthun is tainted the Akh is sure to come next. The Akh is inadequately translated as 'soul' into this language. It is the unseen spiritual centre hidden deep in all that is alive, and it is each living creature's most prized possession. It is the very essence of being. And it is our most vulnerable part.", 2821 String="So the seven were banished to the depths of seven cursed tombs. There they are waiting, imprisoned for eternity.\nOne was buried outside the city in the shadows of the south-eastern tower, close to the pharaoh yet forever banished from his grace.\nOne was buried in the ancient ruins far to the north, a tribute to her love for all that is old.\nOne was buried at the tar pits. Blackness engulfed his withering heart, and blackness shall engulf his final demise.\nOne was buried in the fields of stone. His will was as hard as a rock, so lifeless stone will cause his fall.\nOne was buried near the Mountain, between its eternal body and a small stony hill, so that his rest may be eternal and unrelenting like the mountain he loved so much.\nOne was buried somewhere on the peninsula to the south, so that his restless slumber might be soothed by the murmuring of the waves.\nOne was buried not far to the north of the oasis. He was the one who found it most difficult to part from this world.\nThe sands of the desert swallowed them all and sealed their fate. They are lost and yet they are denied the peace of true death.\nThis is the fate of those who draw the wrath of the pharaoh on themselves."}}}
