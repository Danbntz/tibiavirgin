Their raids have become more frequent with each month since the rain season has ended. I guess they don't like showers. Given their savageness and unpredictability it is not easy to come up with a counter strategy. It is obvious that the majority of the apes are trying to distract our guards while others sneak in and steal equipment of all sorts. Some of them are agile like ... well, like monkeys. Hard to catch - and they are sort of escape artists and might hide right under the ceiling. I even had one report of a citizen finding a monkey hiding in his depot box after a raid. Given the number of men at our disposal it is impossible to defend each and every side of the settlement. No sort of barricade would be of any help considering the nature of our attackers. \nThey get into and out of our fort just as it pleases them, and even the upper levels of the town that have proven to be safe against other beasts of the jungle are no hindrance to them. I see no real option to stop those attacks unless an army is sent here to find the apes' base of operation which seems to be somewhere in the north eastern jungle.

Even though many adventurers and soldiers of fortune had been able to pick up their rewards, the situation was worse than ever as the ape raids came even more frequently and ferociously. The loss of lives and the senseless destruction of property had increased enormously. Sadly Jorgin Beargin, the spokesman of the Venoran traders, was called back to Venore to report about the recent losses.\nThe traders are now asking us to keep adventurers from provoking the ape men in any way.

I support the traders' demand that the king should intervene. A well armed warship with some experienced fighters would not only secure the routes, but also boost our line of defence in Port Hope. With their support we could fight back such enemies like the ape men - or even capture Trapwood, an area rich in bamboo that is populated by those murderous dworcs.

I sent word to Thais that such events destroy the peace of our colony and that we would probably do better to rely on the more disciplined seamen of Venore who are more accustomed to the hardships of long journeys than the men of the Thaian marine.

While sleeping, they suddenly stood beside their own body and watched over it. The magician proved that the 'fever' actually was caused by a small bug. This bug injects a mildly toxic hallucinogen into the body of a sleeping person causing the mentioned phenomenon. Borsoz developed a paste that, when applied to the walls and the floor, keeps those bugs away. All settlers were provided with the paste and the \"fever\" has been efficiently eradicated.
