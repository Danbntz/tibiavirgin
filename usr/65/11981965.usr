Most adventurers die through monsters - be it because people are not well enough prepaired, be it because some people are surprised by eighter the apperance or the powers of a monster, be it because suddenly there are 20 monsters where you have expected only one. Always be aware: Our land is in fact dangerous and you always have to take into account that arround the next corner some monsters await you - monsters which you have never seen before!\nOf course, I have a little story on this topic:\nOne adventurer of the five - his trip was at least 18 days shorter than the trip of Hestus, who was one year jounger than him - climbed down a ladder, not thinking about the danger he might be in. When he finally touched the ground again, he saw himself eye in eye with a fire-spitting dragon. He tried to flee - too late. His body was found weeks after his death...\nJust to mention it: none of the two explorers mentioned above (Hestus and the man who was killed by a dragon) were 41 years old.

Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.

Two more of our adventurers (the ones I always tell about) were attacked by monsters:\nElaeus and the man, whos journey ended after 66 days, both were attacked by monsters. Both were jounger than Gadinius and the man who only barely escaped from the attacks of a mother-bear, who defended her babies.

I tried it with the sharpest sword I own,\nand I can tell for sure: It is not possible to divide a grain of sand!\nTherefore, everything around us is made out of sand.\nYou might say: Hold on!

Furthermore, I found out the words for \"yes\" and \"no\". \"Yagla\" means \"yes\", \"glub\" means \"no\", but it's also the word for \"none\", \"not\", and so on.\nI just wonder why they keep on calling me \"gar\".
