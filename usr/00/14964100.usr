The battles were furious and bloody and for along time no side was\napparently winning. Uman gave humans the art of magic and instructed them in the magic crafts. But even the sorcerers could\nnot turn the tables. Some of them turned thereupon away from Uman and called Crunor their lord, in order to serve from then\non as druids for the forces of the life. Together with the godly world tree Crunor they created many of the creatures, that\npopulate the wilderness today, although a variety of these creatures was extinguished in the wars of that time. \nBanor however chose the noblest of the mortal ones, Kirana, as its wife, and she bore him Elane, which possessed as much\nvirtue as combat and magical powers. And she became the first of the noble paladins. Until our times the leader of the paladins\nis in honors to her a woman and assumes the honorary name Elane.
