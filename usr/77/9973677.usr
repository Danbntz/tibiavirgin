I almost got killed by the hunter, I wasn't too noobish to think it was a pker. The three of us killed the hunter, and Will took the arrows. Nothing much in it. \n   Also this was the first time I was going to travel to thais. Fatmonkey finally logged on again.\n   \"Where u?\"\n   \"Thais.\"\n   \"THais? whas that?\" I remebered seeing it, but don't remeber. \"how u get there?\"\n   \"Walk.\" I think he was trying to be sarcastic. \n   \"Really?\" I thought that the only place I can go was Carlin, casue back in rook it told me to choose a homeland. I chose Carlin.\n   Better yet, I exiva'd Fatmonkey and it said Southwest. I traveld southwest following the path. Will stayed back in Carlin. I leveled up on the way to Thais.\n\n               Chapter 10 (level 18-22)\n\n   After discovering Thais, I explored around it, like Mino Field. I saw a couple of level 20s, they were being chased by a Mino guard, I didn't really know what it was so I wasted some hmms on it. I dealt around 40-55 damage, and I saw Xavier Razorwind's dead body." Editor="Horobi Ascendant", 3505 String="   Pary went down to lure the Demon Skeleton onto the hole so I can rope it. He popped back up with yellow life, but he cassted a couple of exura grans and then we was back at green. I fished on the hole for a couple of seconds, then the Ds finally felt like showing up. It targeted me first, I ran around, i was blocked by some ghouls, but nothing hmm coudln't handle. The Ds finally got to me, I got slapped around for 110 damage, and I freaked out. I casted Exura gran, and ran down the first hole I saw, but I quickly regreted it. Another DS was down there, I roped myself up, and saw the Ds running from me. I went to get a closer view, and saw pary ate yellow, the Ds changed targets, I chucked a few Hmms at the Ds, did around 35-45 damage. Will also kept on shooting it for 10-50 damage. We managed to kill the Ds in the end, but got crap lot, Throwingstar and torch. All that hard work for nothing.\n   Will actually wasn't rotten about how I ditched the DS, he just said that:\n   \"Yeah DS's hit HARD.\" That was probably the closes I ever got from dieing from a DS. Will and me leveld like one level up, before we left. \n   \"That was fun.\" No duh it was, but I wanted to comment on it.\n   \"Yep, yo I'm going back to carlin to sell my stuff ok?\"\n   \"Ill come too.\" I went on auto follow and sooner or later we arrived. I sold all the maces, brass helmets, and viking helmets I got, made a bundle.\n   \"I gotta log, you gonna be on tommorrow?\" Will sold the last of his items.\n   \"Yeah sure, ima gonna vip u k?\"\n   ''Me too ;).\" He logged, I was satisfied with that day, I had made a bundle and leveld up to 16. And best of all, I made a really cool friend.\n   Being 16 reminded me of Saint Horobi, thats when I stopped playing with him, now I wanted to Get pass the 16 barrier, and get to 17. \n   Will logged on like he had said, Jun was also on. I introduced my pal to my rl friend. They never really got to know each other though... Will, Jun and I went east a bit, we explored Fermur Hills" Editor="Horobi Ascendant", 3505 String="                  Chapter 9 (level 13-17)\n\n   Around this time I was familiar with Carlin. My brother was the one that discovered Ghostland too. In a pretty funny way too. He was just exploring around and somehow got stuck in the west, which is Gland. He went down a hole \"accidentaly\" and it was the one with Fire Devil. He went south and down the steps, and then got hit for A LOT from it. He died, and I laughed... In my head.\n   I started officiallu exploring Gland when i was like level 15. Me and Jun hunted there a let, we forgot bout Folda. O yeah this was the time when the Update for the Soulpoints was added. Ghouls were really annoying to us, we had to double rape it like we did with the witches. \n  Xavier started to hang with me again. This time he was premmy and level 20. He had a guild, Ultimadium, the leader was Oberin, and Elder Druid I think. Xavier invited me to the guild which I happily joined. Also this was a big step for me, I found out having a guild means making new friends and having protection. One of my dearest friend, I met in this guild. His name is Will Pary. \n(mess with him, you also mess with me)\n   I met Pary in Ghostland, he was level 15, and in my guild. Now let's see, how did the conversation go again...\n   \"Hey you're in my guild.\" Felt different knowing that a guildsmember was hunting in your spawn, it felt more... Protective.\n   \"Cool.\" He didn't type much probably cause he was killing a Scorpion.\n   \"Who recruited you?\"\n   \"Oberin.\" (I don't remember who recruited him, but let's jsut say it's Oberin.)\n   I wanted to build up a conversation so I started to introduce myself and ask obvious questions.\n   \"I was recruited by Xavier Razorwind, you know him?\"\n   \"Yeah.\"\n   \"Ur a pally.\" I pointed out stupidly.\n   \"I know, and ur a sorc.\" He was still killing some ghouls. \"Yo can you rope a ds for me?\"\n   I didn't trust him much yet, I thought he would abandon me when the ds came or he would just block my way. But I just gave in. " Editor="Horobi Ascendant", 3505 String="This time I became a sorcerer. Xavier told me to become it so I did. Also, a big thing happened, my RL friend, REALLY GOOD friend, started to play. His character name is Jun Feril, he also became a knight.\n\n                        Chapter 8 (lvl 8-12)\n\n   Jun, Xavier and me usually go to the ammy spawn, we killed a couple of ammy and valks. I got pretty used to it, and I would call myself an Ammy expert, but I didn't stick around ammys for long. Xavier also usually hung out with his other pals, so usually it was me and Jun, we hunted everywhere. \n   Folda, him and me were like, living there, everyday, at least once aday, we would travel there. Also, my brother started a character, but I \nwon't mention him too much, cause his real character apears later on. This was his noob character. I was usually 2-3 levels ahead of Jun, he always wanted to be as GOOD as me. (wink)\n   Nothing much happened when I was 8-12, mostly Folda and Ammy, o yeah, my magic level was pretty high, Xavier kept bugging bout leveling up my magic. Something like this , I was like level 10.\n   \"GET A NEW SPELL!\" Yeah, he wanted me to get Hmm so I can give it to him for free.\n   \"Like what? i got light, light healing, and antidote.\" Crappy spells.\n   \"Get hmm!\"\n   \"Whats hmm? oyeah that purple thing u used on the ammy right, and there was like eletricty.\" Whatta noob I was.\n  \"Come follow me, i show u where it is.\" I went to Auto follow, he led me to the Sorcerer guild. I had money with me, I bought Hmm.\n   \"How to make one?\" I knew the words, but I kept on poofing.\n   \"Frick! Getta rune noob!\" \n   \"Rune?\" I knew what it was but didn't know how to get one, I think I got him pretty angry as usual.\n   I bought the rune and casted it, it took like my whole Mana bar away, I was amazed. Then for like the next 3 days, I was just manasitting, and fishing. Made like 3 Bps, and got my ML to 21 when I was level 11. Pretty good I would say. But we're not in the better part of my Adventure yet.\n\n      \n " Editor="Horobi Ascendant", 3505 String="   \"Ammy or folda?\" Those are our biggest hunting spots.\n   \"Ammy, I'm gonna solo witch.\" Watta cocky guy.\n   \"U died last time.\"\n   \"I want revenge.\" \n   \"What ever.\"\n   We arrived at the ammy camp, just like 2 people, liek lvl 13, we were like 15, and 18 so we shoed them away.\n   \"I'll kill ammy.\"\n   \"K, valk mine.\" He charged the valk, dealt like 10-30 per hit, it died. \"SWEET protection amm.\"\n   \"COOl can i have?\" I never really knew what it did, so i wanted it.\n   \"NO WAY! IT like deflects 10 damage!\" \n   \"Really?\"\n   \"YEAH!\" He headed for the witch, and went up. I didn't wait, i also went up and got burned. We double raped it and it died. I got like 30 exp, and he got the rest. \"Eww broom.\"\n   \"Folda now?\"\n   \"Sure.\"\n\n                               Chapter 6\n   I paid the 20 gp. And we got there. Some level 20s, but we still went. Went to the mino triangle and came back with lots of loot. Then we see a level 10 noob, named Scon Bros. My first pk, we killed him easily.\n  \"Yo xavier wanna pk him?\"\n   \"OK.\"\n   Xavier started to attack Scon Bros. He started to run back to the entrance, but got cornered.\n   \"Plx no kill. Plx no kill. Free items.\" He was definetly scared. \"BR? I GIVE FREE ITEMS.\" I hesitated to kill Scon Bros, but Xavier just killed him. We got some loot, then waited for the skull to go away, then we left. Folda is boring to write about, so back to Carlin.\n   We sold the loot we got from Scon Bros, and went to ammy camp again. Killed a few ammy and valk and leveled up to 16. Xavier logged off, and I hung out with Fatmonkey. We skilled near the valks, and I Lagged BAD, and died from 2 valks. A noob looted my body, so again Xavier came and killed him, what was his name again, Smint Strognioff, some crap like that. Xavier had a skull again. Then Tergus came and pked him, thats when I became.... AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.... HOROBI ASCENDANT.\n   I'll write about him when I was level 8. \n\n                             Chapter 7\n   Xavier kept his character." Editor="Horobi Ascendant", 3505 String="   \"Ummmm a wolf.\" What a stupid question... \"Kill it.\"\n   I was actually kinda scared, but I attacked it. Took me a while, I had a short sword. After the wolf died, i was surprised, I got 18%! Pretty good. I forgot all about the rats, rats were rats. I killed like 6 wolves then leveled up. I was lvl 3 now.\n   \"Wanna kill skels?\" Fatmonkey was very jumpy in hunting, from wolves, to skeletons, then to poison spiders, but I still kept up with him. \n   \"Sure.\" I didn't know what I was putting myself up to. We went deep in the cave, the one north of the NOOB bridge, that's what we called it. Then we arrived at skeletons. \n   \"I'll tank.\" He's level six, so I was ok with it. We went down the hole, then killed 1 skeleton.\n   \"WOW! 35 exp!\"\n   \"Yep.\" He was yellow, then he went ahead to the other hole. The one with 3. I followed him.\n   \"HURRY! KILL!\" He ran in circles, I slowly followed, I managed to kill one, but only one, then we went back up. We were nearly dead.\n   \"DAMN!\"\n   \"... Y didnt u kill em?\" He seemed angry. Then we left. It was half way out the cave when he logged out.\n   \"Gotta log cya.\" He left just like that, poof. He's gone. I got lost, but managed my way out and went back to rookgard.\n\n                            Chapter 5\n   We did the same thing everyday till I was 8. Don't really want to jump into details in rookgard, so I'll skip to Main. \n   Fatmonkey was with me when we went to main, he turned to a druid, and I turned to a Knight. Now this is where I made other true friends, besides Fatmonkey, all rookgard friends didn't last. Now I aslo can introduce Xavier Razorwind. One last thing, I'm gonna speed through this cause, writing about Saint Horobi is boring, I wanna get to myself, Horobi Ascendant. \n   Xavier Razorwind did A LOT for me, showed me Ammy Camp, Folda, choosing weapons, Spells, Skilling, and about the party pk. He hunted with me a lot, till i was like 16. Here's just a short brief way of how we hunted.\n   " Editor="Horobi Ascendant", 3505 String="                         Chapter 3\n\n   Wow first day and already 3 characters... Pathetic. Third character, I named him Saint Horobi, I needed a miracle to happen. This time I ASKED someone before falling into a hole. I jsut wandered around the square for a while, then killed some rats, and leveled up to 2. Then a player comes up to me, his name was Fatmonkey, my first true friend, and still on this day is one of my truest friend. He may be a pothead, but he still kicks ass.\n   \"Ur yello.\" I can see he had a lot of misspelled words, but, it IS Tibia.\n   \"Ya, how do you heal?\" My hp wasn't going up.\n   \"U eet, coem.\" He must be in a rush if he typed that bad. He lead me to berries, and i ate em.\n   \"Im not healing.\" \n   \"Noob, you wait and it'll heal.\" So, I waited and I did heal.\n   \"Thanks man.\" \n   \"No probs. U spagnol?\" I thought he was br, or whatever br was.\n   \"Nope.\" I was gonna have fun with him.\n   \"What are you?\"\n   \"Ur gonna laugh when i tell u.\" I was gonna make up some bs.\n   \"No i wont.\" I bet he will.\n   I came up with the strangest combination. \"Im korean/african/german/irish/japanese/mexican.\"\n   \"O cool.\" Yeah right like that's really cool. I don't even think I ever told him the truth...\n   \"I'm green yay.\" \n   \"Wanna hunt?\"\n                           Chapter 4\n\n   Again, since I was a noob I came up with the dumbest idea. I wanted to go hunt rats. Fatmonkey had to trick me into crossing the bridge, cause I kept telling him I couldn't cross the bridge.\n   \"Yo cross the bridge.\"\n   \"Cant, tried already.\"\n   \"Grrr... you can find lots of rats there.\" \n   \"I can find them here.\" We were talking in the bridge, so then he started to push me then he blocked my way. The only way was norht. \"Look i CANT cross the bridge.\" I crossed it, and I did pass it.\n   \"Dumass.\" Fatmonkey led the way.\n   \"U said theres rats here right, cause they give me 5 %.\" I was so stubborn.\n   \"Yeah yeah, theres millions.\" He led to wolves... \n   \"Whats that?\"" Editor="Horobi Ascendant", 3505 String="                           Chapter 1\n\n   Well it all started when my real life friend Xavier Razorwind introduced me to tibia. He was level 12 I think, and he thought he was all SO cool. He's a cool guy but also bad. My first character, what was it's name again, o yeah, Angel of Rath, he had a decent named but crappy color. \n  First day, I got stuck in the ladder.  So like a noob I started to ask stupid noob question. I don't really remeber the guys name I asked, but let's just say his name is BOBBY.\n   \"Hey, do you know how to go up the ladder?\" I was pretty ticked, cause I already tried everything but it didn't work.\n   \"Use the ladder.\" Yeah, that really helped.\n   I kept on clicking ont he ladder but, it didn't work. That ticked me off.\n   \"I am but it's not working.\"\n   \"Use the ladder, you know right click and use.\" He left.\n   I was on for like an hour or so till I logged. Wow, an hour down in a small cellar. I created a new character, Horobi Hunter.\n                           Chapter 2\n   I reminded myself not to go down the stairs again. I went west of Tom, the guy that buys those dead rats, I still can't figure out why he bought them. O well. I saw dead sheeps but none alive, so I explored around, went north a bit and saw a small black thing. I went and steped on it then I fell down, again, another ladder. I waited like 3 minutes, then someone came down. Again, I dont remeber his name, but lets say its HANK.\n   \"How do you get upstairs?\" \n   \"Br?\"\n   I was baffled, I had to ask, but I knew it was a noob question. \"What's Br?\"\n   \"Que?\" Good thing i take spanish class in my school, actually, Spanish 3*. The * is for the slower spanish learners. \n   \"Yo hablo mucho pequeno espanol.\" Took me a while to type all that.\n   \"O, si si, BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.\" No offense to spanish speakers here, I didnt understand a word he said besides si. Then he logged.\n   I stood there, just standing there, for another 5 minutes then logged.\n\n                            \n" Editor="Horobi Ascendant", 2839}}, 2869 Content={3065, 3279, 3092, 3066, 3097 SavedExpireTime=1286, 3097, 3097, 3097, 3568, 3074, 3287 Amount=1, 3050}, 2854 Content={2857 Content={3505 String="Horobi Ascendant\nThais\n\nDear Horobi,\nI have quit the game becuase there are so many assholes out there and im pissed off therefore u get all my stuff being the best cyber freind out there.\nPlz exept the presents i have sent u because i still owe u for saving my life.\nIf it ever happens ill come back on line one day just to talk and possibly play again but don't get ur hopes up cuz im still pissed at the fact my so called\n(good freind) doucette killed me becuase he wanted his fuckin ass to be safe so he put my ass on the line. i attemted to PK him but i failed and died again, hes \"my bad\" but i was to pissed to listen to him. so horobi or w/e ur real name is take my stuff and use it well.\n\nUr good friend    PÄtThEmÄNn\n\nSo long and good night" Editor="Patthemann"}, 3583 Amount=84, 3585 Amount=4, 3593, 3589 Amount=3, 3590 Amount=1}, 3503 Content={3504 Content={3275, 3275, 3275, 3275, 3410, 3283, 2853 Content={2471 Content={2853 Content={3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410}, 2853 Content={3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3354, 3354}, 2853 Content={3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3354, 3410, 3354, 3410}, 2853 Content={3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3410, 3354}, 2853 Content={3410}}, 2853 Content={3367, 3275, 3275}}, 3507 String="horobi ascendant\nthais" Editor="Horobi Ascendant"}, 3507 String="Horobi ascendant\ncarlin" Editor="Horobi Ascendant"}, 3502 Content={2861 Content={2854, 2867, 2865, 2866, 2854 Content={3092 SavedExpireTime=1647, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017, 3017}, 2871, 2867 Content={2874 ContainerLiquidType=10, 2874 ContainerLiquidType=10, 2874 ContainerLiquidType=10, 2874 ContainerLiquidType=10}, 2854}, 2854 Content={2854 Content={2854 Content={3084 RemainingUses=250, 3085 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3083 RemainingUses=150, 3045 RemainingUses=200}, 2869 Content={3045 RemainingUses=200, 3054 RemainingUses=178, 3083 RemainingUses=150, 3045 RemainingUses=200, 3083 RemainingUses=150, 3045 RemainingUses=200, 3054 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=198, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3083 RemainingUses=150, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=200}, 2854 Content={3056 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3085 RemainingUses=200, 3045 RemainingUses=200, 3045 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3085 RemainingUses=181, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3083 RemainingUses=149, 3572, 3012, 3012, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3083 RemainingUses=150, 3045 RemainingUses=197, 3012, 3012, 3012, 3085 RemainingUses=200}}, 2867 Content={3050, 3050, 3050, 3050, 3050, 3050, 3097, 3097, 3097, 3097, 3097, 3050}}, 2854 Content={2868 Content={2868 Content={3299, 3299, 3299, 3299, 3299, 3110, 3110, 3110, 3110, 3110, 3110}, 2955, 2955, 2955, 3463, 2955}, 2854 Content={3287 Amount=1, 3077, 3004, 3077, 3046 SavedExpireTime=2998, 2953, 2989, 2989, 2989, 3077, 2989, 3008, 3004, 3077, 2989, 2989, 3473}, 2854 Content={3463, 2955, 3059, 3563, 3473, 3077}}, 2868 Content={2969 KeyNumber=3620, 2969 KeyNumber=3610, 2969 KeyNumber=3650, 2969 KeyNumber=5000, 2970 KeyNumber=4601, 2970 KeyNumber=3142, 2969 KeyNumber=4055, 2868 Content={2969 KeyNumber=4055, 2970 KeyNumber=4601, 2970 KeyNumber=3303, 2970 KeyNumber=3301, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2969 KeyNumber=5000, 2970 KeyNumber=3800, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2969 KeyNumber=3600, 2969 KeyNumber=3033, 2969 KeyNumber=4600, 2969 KeyNumber=5010}, 2865 Content={2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2969 KeyNumber=3600, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2970 KeyNumber=4503, 2970 KeyNumber=4503, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2970 KeyNumber=4601, 2969 KeyNumber=4600, 2969 KeyNumber=4600, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2969 KeyNumber=4600, 2970 KeyNumber=4503, 2973 KeyNumber=3520}, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2969 KeyNumber=4600, 2969 KeyNumber=4600, 2969 KeyNumber=4055, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2969 KeyNumber=3600, 2969 KeyNumber=3033, 2973 KeyNumber=3520, 2969 KeyNumber=4600}}},
