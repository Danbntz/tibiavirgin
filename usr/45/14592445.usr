They wove a powerful spell, the spell of the creation, in order to bind Tibiasulas essence to the\ncolumn of time. As Zathroth laughed loudly, in his vain triumph, he did not understand their words, and so the secret of creation\nand life stayed hidden from him forever. \nThey however wove the fleeting elements to powerful strands. Althought they did not succeed in uniting them again but the\nindividual parts became something new, the first real creation. \nThus the living part became Tibia, born from the element earth, Sula became the sea washing around it. Air rose over the\ncreation and layed itself like a protecting blanket over the creation, and the fire seeped under it and began to warm it up. \nBehold: Each of the separate parts of the god was full of life and divinity! But none of the elements possessed the spirit of the\nTibiasula, but they were wild and impetuous, following always the impulses which corresponded to their nature. ", 2853}},
