But Zathroth used a deception and appeared to the earth as its other side, Uman, and conceived in his place a being.\nThis was the birth of Urgith, the master of the undead. \nAnd immediately the dead ones began to raise themselves on his calling, and they all were his creatures. Like the orcs before\nthem, now the undead covered the body of the mother Tibia, and his children, the rats, were Urgith's messengers and scouts. \nThen however Uman and Tibia united, as it had been agreed upon, and Toth was born. Toth became the guardian of the\ndead ones and sent his large worms which began to devour the undead. For a long time the struggle lasted and again no end\nwas to be foreseen.

And as the\ndivinity was weakened by the creation and without suspicion and resistance, the deadly attack penetrated to the core of her\nbeing and destroyed her. \nThe elements - fires, water, earth and air - were jerked out of their harmony and landed at the base of the column of time.", 2816 String="The Great Creation BOOK ONE\n\nUman in his wisdom recognized the possibilities, which revealed themselves to them here, and he asked Tibiasula join in the\ncircle of the creators and help them with the task of the creation. Tibiasula agreed, because she also was fascinated by the idea\nof the creation. \nUman, whose nature was to win secrets and gain insights, had relized what their error at the preceding attempts had been:\nWithout a fixed pivot point there was no existence possible, and everything had to diffuse away as it was without direction and\ntarget. \nAnd to remedy that he invented TIME! \nIn order to create the time, the Gods united their powers. Even Zathroth was fascinated by the idea of his other half and\ncontributed a tiny proportion of his strength to the effort. The wise claim that it is to be due to his working that all time strives in\nthe long run to decay and destruction. \nThe powers of the godly bundled themselves to an enormous power greater than any in existence before. It began to\ncrystallize itself in the void to an enormous spiral. Higher and higher it mounted up, became firmness, pivot point, direction and\naim of existence! And in such a way the crystal column of time grew upwards and was from then on the unmovable center of\ncreation.

All of them were defeated! Almost\neveryone of the old races, which we know only as the Ancients, was defeated and buried by the sands of the time, because\nthey were on match to the agressive rage and the emontionless intrepidity of their opponents. \nAccording to our knowledge, only the delicate elves in their cities deep in the forests and the dwarves in their fortresses deep\nunder the mountains survived the corpse wars, although at some campfires rumors are spread about other races, created by\nboth sides for this unholy war, and of which some individuals are said to still be around. \nJust as strong and powerful as these peoples were, they were one-sided and of little flexibility. Worse still: Some creatures\nsuccumbed to the temptations of Zathroth about power and great knowledge. They switched sides, and rumor has it that the\nmost powerful of the Ancients were hurled out of this world by the good Gods for their betrayal to suffer eternally in the sphere,\nwhich was created in order to punish them for their misdeeds, and changed to what nowadays is called the daemons. \nAll their magic, which was probably given to the old peoples in excess, could not make them victorious, and they and their\nbuildings disappeared gradually from the face of Tibia.", 2816 String="The Creation of Humans BOOK ONE\n\nThere the Gods created the first human, Banor, the godly warrior! This entity was filled by the godly power and was full of\ncourage and responsibility. After his image and with parts of his body the Gods created him attendants, Humans. \nNobody knows, which Gods brought their powers into the recent creation, and some say that Zathroth spoiled also this\ncreation. Yes, some even state that the good Gods created a twin for Banor, which should embody the powers of magic,\nwhose raw form however was stolen by Zathroth, and he had manufactured from it the first daemonic lords to lead his\nattendants from hell. \nWhichever it might be, in any case the humans took on the fight against the crowds of the undead and probably against the\ndragons, orcs and their unholy attendants, too, and Banor was a glorious leader for mankind. ", 2816 String="The Creation of Humans BOOK TWO\n\nThus the age of the wars of the unliving began. The battles were furious and bloody and for along time no side was\napparently winning. Uman gave humans the art of magic and instructed them in the magic crafts. But even the sorcerers could\nnot turn the tables. Some of them turned thereupon away from Uman and called Crunor their lord, in order to serve from then\non as druids for the forces of the life. Together with the godly world tree Crunor they created many of the creatures, that\npopulate the wilderness today, although a variety of these creatures was extinguished in the wars of that time. \nBanor however chose the noblest of the mortal ones, Kirana, as its wife, and she bore him Elane, which possessed as much\nvirtue as combat and magical powers. And she became the first of the noble paladins. Until our times the leader of the paladins\nis in honors to her a woman and assumes the honorary name Elane.

Whereever Banor appeared personally to lead the\narmies of humans, they triumphed, but on the other battlegrounds they were too often crushed by the dark crowds. \nThus Banor asked the gods to help him and the gods in their infinite wisdom created the portal of the souls. By means this\nmystic of gate souls from planes of existence far, far away of Tibia could be called in order to assume the shape of heroes. \nWith these champions as leaders the humans turned the tables in the great war. They alone under all the mortals had the\npossibility of becoming similar to Banor, uniting power and cunning.

The world was fragile, the boundaries between the worlds cracked by the enormous powers, which had been\nemployed. Already the armies of the older races were readying themselves to recapture from the humans what the old ones\nregarded as theirs. Already the children of the darkness, hardly troubled by the undead, risen again to new powers, were\nwaiting to spread chaos over the world. Already the dragons sharpened their talons on their rock, in order to rise again into air\nto devastate the world in a fiery nightmare. Already the victorious armies of humans threw possessive looks on new targets.\nAlready the daemons hammered on the walls of their breakable prison.

They looked down upon the desintegrating world, and they decided an armistice,\nbecause they all wanted power over the creation, not its complete destruction. Thus the Gods threw the charm of the new\nbeginning over the world! Only gradually the recovering sections of the old world started to rise from the nebulas of time,\nawakened the old races and old frights back to life. It is said that the city of Tibia was the first to rise again, barren of almost all\nlife, without all magic, on a tiny island, deserted and almost devoid of life ... and nevertheless full of age-old secrets. And soon\nafterwards life returned to the world. \nAlso via the portal of souls old and new heroes found their way to Tibia. Gradually larger sections of the old world emerged\nfrom the nebulas, further natures and miracles. But the world is still far from its former splendour and size, and we live in times\nof change. What today is still natural, may as soon as tomorrow be only a legend, what today is still fantasy, may already\ntomorrow be reality. \nBut hear ye and listen: Bad spirits also arrived and still arrive by the portal in our realm, in order to do mischief in human\nshape.
