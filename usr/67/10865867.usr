They put him in heavy chains and brought him before Gabel's throne. There the old man stood, all haggard and torn, amidst the splendour of the djnns' court. And the djinns started teasing and tormenting the human with a thousand malicious tricks, trying to strike terror in his heart. But frail and crippled though he was, Daraman never so much as flinched under the pain, and his will could not be broken. Finally Malor, who was the most vicious and godless of the djinn, lost his patience and raised his hand to strike the final blow. But lo!, just when his deadly scimitar was about to strike the prisoner down Gabel's voice thundered through the hall, ordering Malor to stop. And though mighty Malor trembled with anger and spite, he did not dare challenge his king's authority.", 3358, 3358, 3358, 3358, 3358, 3358, 2853 Content={3409, 3377, 3377, 3377, 3377, 3377, 3377, 3377}, 2831 String="The Djinn Wars I - The Insurrection\n\nFor a long time Malor had plotted and schemed in secrecy, using promises and threats to recruit followers and to form alliances. Many djinn refused to betray Gabel, but the majority of the strongest djinn warriors rallied to his cause, and since Malor had been plotting his insurrection for a long time the rebels were well-prepared. When Malor finally gave the signal his minions attacked the palace in full force, planning to kill Gabel swiftly. Their attack was deadly effective, and the palace guards were quickly overwhelmed. However, Gabel, who had received warning about the conspiracy was saved in time by his trusted aide and friend Fa'hradin. He managed to flee in the darkness, and that very night he started to gather his troops in order to take revenge on the usurper. Malor, on the other hand, had to acknowledge that his plan to get rid of Gabel quickly had failed. And he ordered his followers to prepare for a long-term military engagement. Neither he nor Gabel realised then that this was the starting point for a war that would last for eons."}, 2868 Content={2867 Content={2865, 2867 Content={3316, 2867 Content={3046 SavedExpireTime=13, 3046 SavedExpireTime=2999, 3294, 3291, 3267, 3299}, 3330, 3266, 3282, 3305, 3046 SavedExpireTime=2975, 3327, 3273, 3285, 3293, 3289, 3310}, 2867 Content={3358}, 2867 Content={3384, 3362}}}}, 3031 Amount=75, 3457, 3483, 3456}},
