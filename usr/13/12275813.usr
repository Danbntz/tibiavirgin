The astral patterns wax and wane like the tides, and it is not possible to perform certain summonings on inappropriate days, to give but one example. The study of astrology is pointing at further influences that go well beyond summoning creatures, though. For instance, the influence of the stars and the suns seems to increase with the power level of the performed incantation or ritual. The more mana is used in a spell the more it is susceptible to extratibian influence. For this reason it seems quite safe to assume that certain powerful rituals are only possible when the stars are correctly aligned. We consequently hope to achieve through close observation and through careful calculation a measure of exactness concerning the right timing of rituals which we did not dare dream of so far. Several magic incantations we have never managed to reproduce until now might actually be achieved once we know the ideal stellar constellations. This would explain why all our previous attempts to achieve these effects were doomed to fail.", 2825 String="The great pyramid is the centre of our beloved city. It is there that our praised pharaoh resides, surrounded by his trusted servants. Far below the palace, hidden in the deepest dungeons of the ancient pyramid are the tombs of despair. The old pharaoh met his fate there, and it is said he still roams the hidden passageways, bound forever to his undead body. So great was the wisdom of Arkhothep that he granted his father eternal unlife, so that he may to atone for his sins and become worthy of ascension. Who knows? Perhaps one day he, too, will ascend, leaving both the curse and his tomb behind him and taking his place at Arkhothep's side. But I fear his folly defies all attempt to cure it. He has proved unyielding to the wisdom of his son's preachings for as long as I can remember. Long will be his road, and a million deaths he shall die before he will see the light of the wisdom that will free him from his prison.", 2843}, 2857 Content={3093, 3097 SavedExpireTime=3596, 3083 RemainingUses=150}, 2871 Content={2854 Content={3054 RemainingUses=200, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3097, 3093 SavedExpireTime=1796, 3097 SavedExpireTime=2810, 3092 SavedExpireTime=187, 3097, 3097 SavedExpireTime=1128, 3097, 3097, 3097, 3097, 3097, 3097}, 2949, 2969 KeyNumber=4055, 2953}, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854}, 3287 Amount=5}},
