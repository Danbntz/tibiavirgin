In some cases this is clear, if I punch a ball I am the cause of the movement, but whatabout an object falling?\n\nFalling objects head downwards, but what is \"down\", what is below us? The answer is simple: Hell! And who rules hell? Satan! So, obviously Satan is the cause of these movements, Satan is among us all the time. But if he causes these objects to fall, what reason is there that he should not be the cause of all other movements?\n", 2816 String="Alistair Cropwell's Travel Notes\n\n...strange things I saw today!

The symbol appears everywhere, I fear it may have powers that could cause damage in the wrong hands.\n\nI have been travelling so long, I can hardly remember the features of my beloved ones.
