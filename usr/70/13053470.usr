The old pharaoh met his fate there, and it is said he still roams the hidden passageways, bound forever to his undead body. So great was the wisdom of Arkhothep that he granted his father eternal unlife, so that he may to atone for his sins and become worthy of ascension. Who knows? Perhaps one day he, too, will ascend, leaving both the curse and his tomb behind him and taking his place at Arkhothep's side. But I fear his folly defies all attempt to cure it.
