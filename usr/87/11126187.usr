Stripped of almost any possesions, they hid in the caves and learned to become very secretive. They had to work very hard, had to fight for almost any goods with nature and ferocious beasts. Most beasts that could live in such livethreatening circumstances were that powerfull that direct attacks proved to be futile. So the elves begun to develop a more devious way to fight, with assaults, traps and hit and run tactics. After over hundred years they had enough resources to leave the burning lands and adopted their way of live to their new enviroment. So they became the secretive people under the hills. They were fierce fighters whenever their new home was threatened. Some hundred years they fought off all intruders until their explorers made contact with the other remaining elven casts. Under the growing pressure of the more and more powerful waves of orcish attacks they left their homes to join forces with the other elves in an uneasy alliance.\nTheir apperance had changed to a even more slender Version of the normal elves. Their skin is very pale, their hair pure white or pitch black. The younger members of that cast often color strands of their hair in unusual clors like red, blue or purple. Red, albinotic eyes are common, but in general all kinds of eyecolors are existent.\n", 3277 Amount=13, 3492 Amount=15, 2991, 2920 SavedExpireTime=594}, 3504 Content={3074, 2920 SavedExpireTime=599, 3492 Amount=50, 3277 Amount=2, 3492 Amount=100, 3492 Amount=100, 3492 Amount=100, 3492 Amount=90}, 2922 SavedExpireTime=264, 2920, 2853 Content={3277 Amount=2, 3008, 2969 KeyNumber=4600, 3054 RemainingUses=200, 3483, 3456}, 3153 Charges=1, 3504 Content={3362, 2874 ContainerLiquidType=6, 3359, 3085 RemainingUses=200}, 2955, 3008, 3085 RemainingUses=98, 3050 SavedExpireTime=1795, 3056 RemainingUses=200, 3034 Amount=1, 3285, 3502 Content={3031 Amount=46, 3031 Amount=20, 3031 Amount=100, 3031 Amount=100, 3031 Amount=100, 2868 Content={3198 Charges=3, 3198 Charges=4, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 2868 Content={3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=2, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5, 3198 Charges=5}}, 2857 Content={3098 SavedExpireTime=449, 3046, 3077, 3084 RemainingUses=250}, 3035 Amount=48, 3446 Amount=1, 2854, 3035 Amount=100}},
