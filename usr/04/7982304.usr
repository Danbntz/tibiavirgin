I still regret that you decided to entrust that mercenary Ned Noxiuos with the task and I was only a mere spectator. Although efficiently done, there was no finesse or skill displayed in their elimination. The fallen paladin Ned Noxious simply provoked the said individuals in a tavern. As soon as one of them was stupid enough to draw a weapon, they were disposed by a combination of energy bombs and fireballs. Of course the authorities did little about it since the tavern's patrons did swear the others attacked first. It seems unlikely that Noxious has those abilities in stealthiness and subtle assassination that the stories grant him. ", 2833 String="The so-called tradition among the students to send a newly promoted assassin on some foolish quest has taken another life. The young Roland fell to death while trying to steal the flag from the Thaian castle. Not only that we lost the time and effort we put into his education, the whole affair did draw some unwanted attention on our organisation. It is quite certain that the young fool used some of our highly specialised equipment in his silly stunt. As far as we know the whole affair is still under observation by the local authorities. We have to find a way to draw their attention in another direction before too many questions are asked. I had two of the senior students eliminated to make an example for the future.

The first reports about his activities date back to the pirate conflict that threatened the Venore merchants council. Noxious obviously was hired along with other mercenaries to get rid of some pirate captains that held the usually unorganised pirates under their control. Altough there are no specifics about the affair, Ned Noxious was the only one, out of of the twelve hired mercenaries, that returned to claim his reward. Afterwards he was employed by different persons or groups for undocumented and rather insignificant jobs. His next notable apperance was the elimination of the bandit queen Leerah within her own camp full of renegade amazons. It is assumed that Noxious used invisibility to get to her and quickly killed her before any guards could react. \nFurther accomplishments that are probably related to him:\nThe assassination of the last Thaian mayor of Venore.\nThe assassination of the mage Haramun in Darashia.\nThe assassination of the Mixton Family.\nThe sabotage of the 'Queen Torviva' in the harbor of Carlin. \nThe poisoning of the Edron wells which led to five deaths. \nThe killing of at least six noblemen in provoked duels. \nWe cannot be sure for which felonies he was paid by an unknown party and which of these acts he fulfilled out of sheer morbid pleasure. Still the lack of any proof makes it impossible to punish him adequately. \nAt least three assassination attempts on him have already failed. \n", 3505, 3483, 3504 Content={2853 Content={3375, 3375, 3375, 3375}, 3349, 3349, 3349, 3349, 3349, 3349, 3349, 3507 String="alerus favon\nthais"}, 2870 Content={2854 Content={2854, 2854, 2854, 2854, 2854}, 2871 Content={2871}, 2865, 2867, 2869 Content={2869}}, 2471 Content={3483}, 3502 Content={3012, 3083 RemainingUses=150, 3413, 3148 Charges=2, 3492 Amount=51, 3492 Amount=100, 3492 Amount=100, 3093, 2857, 2865 Content={2968 KeyNumber=3940, 2969 KeyNumber=3600, 2969 KeyNumber=3650, 2969 KeyNumber=3620, 3051, 3008, 3061, 3012, 3085 RemainingUses=200, 3097, 2969 KeyNumber=3650, 2969 KeyNumber=3620, 2969 KeyNumber=3600, 2969 KeyNumber=3033, 2970 KeyNumber=3303, 2969 KeyNumber=3600, 2970 KeyNumber=3800, 2969 KeyNumber=3620, 2969 KeyNumber=3650}, 2854 Content={3308, 2920, 2920 SavedExpireTime=598, 3003, 3003, 3457, 3003, 3483, 3483, 3456, 3308, 3003, 3308, 3304, 3483, 3483, 3481, 3483, 3483, 3456}, 2869 Content={3316, 3316, 3298 Amount=1, 3299}, 2866 Content={3283, 3446 Amount=39, 3447 Amount=41, 3350, 3448 Amount=13, 3287 Amount=53}, 2868 Content={3077, 3655, 3078, 2819 String="Day 1\nThere was an earthquake today, and it seems that the house sunk into the swamp.
