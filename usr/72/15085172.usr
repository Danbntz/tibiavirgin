Already the children of the darkness, hardly troubled by the undead, risen again to new powers, were\nwaiting to spread chaos over the world. Already the dragons sharpened their talons on their rock, in order to rise again into air\nto devastate the world in a fiery nightmare. Already the victorious armies of humans threw possessive looks on new targets.\nAlready the daemons hammered on the walls of their breakable prison.
