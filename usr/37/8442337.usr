However, we are still convinced that in theory it must be capable of divulging additional information such as the experience and power of the targeted persons as well as their general physical condition and the chemical composition of their last supper. There are numerous problems, though, and it is well possible that we have to start all over again. This would mean, of course, that we would have to create some spells to obtain information by means of magic which is plain to see when you are close to the targeted person. One might argue that it is a waste of time and resources to develop such a spell, but then I see no other way to create a similar spell that features enhanced range and a combination of effects.", 3502 Content={}}}
