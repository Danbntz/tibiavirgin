The astral patterns wax and wane like the tides, and it is not possible to perform certain summonings on inappropriate days, to give but one example. The study of astrology is pointing at further influences that go well beyond summoning creatures, though. For instance, the influence of the stars and the suns seems to increase with the power level of the performed incantation or ritual. The more mana is used in a spell the more it is susceptible to extratibian influence. For this reason it seems quite safe to assume that certain powerful rituals are only possible when the stars are correctly aligned. We consequently hope to achieve through close observation and through careful calculation a measure of exactness concerning the right timing of rituals which we did not dare dream of so far. Several magic incantations we have never managed to reproduce until now might actually be achieved once we know the ideal stellar constellations. This would explain why all our previous attempts to achieve these effects were doomed to fail.", 2635, 3448 Amount=3, 3446 Amount=4, 2853 Content={3411, 3411}, 2824 String="Herbs and Plants of the Swamp, Volume II\n\nBlood Herb (herba budinia)\nA plant with large, dark red-colored blossoms. \nIt is nearly extinct due to its lack of strength - the herb can only survive in the shade, and often only by draining nitrates from trees, which die in the process.
