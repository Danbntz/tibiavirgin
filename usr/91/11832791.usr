I sealed Goshnar's grave so noone can enter the pits without knowledge of our secret. I will try to retreat to knightwatch tower and wait for a dreamer in possession of the key, so we can travel one of the dreampaths to a safer place to regroup and plan a counterattack. I fear we have to recruit new members and there is only little time left to train them. I hope Taciror will not waste our last forces in a futile attack on the ruthless seven. Our order has never truly recovered from the losses in our war against Goshnar and his undead hordes. Now with the death of our leaders and best warriors in the attack of the demonic forces we don't stand a chance against our enemies. Our only hope is to gather new forces and retake the chamber of dreams. Of couse I know the right method to distract hugo long enough to get past him. The dreammaster is important to teach our recruits in the old ways and the art of dreamwalking. We need a leader for our cause and we need him bad. Headless we will fail and fall. It's already uncertain who took the nightmare chronicles out of the pits and I have no idea where they hid them. They are fighting about power and influence but unity is the key to success. Our whole order is centred about unity.
