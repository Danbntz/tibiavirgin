The smaler cousin of the tibian oak is a fast growing tree and so the most common wood supply on rookgaard as well as on the continent. \nOnly botanist can distiguisch the dwarfenoak from the strang rookguard banannatree. On rookguard there is an oaklike plat which fruits resemble Bannanas in shape and tase that much. noone can make out the difference of the fruits. To all persons without knowledge in botanology the only hint to find a bannanatree is the witheblossom flower that often seems to live in a kind of symbiosis with the cherry tree. \nThe dragontongue plant is easily spotted by its deep red blossoms and rumored to be an usefull reagent in varrious alchemical potions. \nThe swamplants re that numerous and various that we didn't have a chance for an extensive calssification.
