All of them were defeated! Almost\neveryone of the old races, which we know only as the Ancients, was defeated and buried by the sands of the time, because\nthey were no match to the agressive rage and the emotionless intrepidity of their opponents. \nAccording to our knowledge, only the delicate elves in their cities deep in the forests and the dwarves in their fortresses deep\nunder the mountains survived the corpse wars, although at some campfires rumors are spread about other races, created by\nboth sides for this unholy war, and of which some individuals are said to still be around. \nJust as strong and powerful as these peoples were, they were one-sided and of little flexibility. Worse still: Some creatures\nsuccumbed to the temptations of Zathroth about power and great knowledge. They switched sides, and rumor has it that the\nmost powerful of the Ancients were hurled out of this world by the good Gods for their betrayal to suffer eternally in the sphere,\nwhich was created in order to punish them for their misdeeds, and changed to what nowadays is called the daemons. \nAll their magic, which was probably given to the old peoples in excess, could not make them victorious, and they and their\nbuildings disappeared gradually from the face of Tibia.", 2853, 2853}, 3277 Amount=1, 3277 Amount=1}},
