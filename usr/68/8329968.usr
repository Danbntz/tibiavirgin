This gives them the oppurtunity to appear somewhere out of the blue, but, fortunately, the Teshial never used this skill to ambush, and the other elves posess only small remnants of this magic.\nNever the less, the 2nd earthen chamber is evolving a counter spell for that, that increases the elemental signature of beings near, forcing them into the real realm.\n\nThe other kinds of their magics are limited to protective and growing spells, whicht yet do not prove any harm, but are very supportive for their strife. It is rumored that they have also a lot of illusionary and concealing spells, but investigations here have not yet led to final results, as well as we can only deny the existance of aggressive magic by an elven race od caste od unknown origin.\n\nFor further information refer to sub-report AX-27.\n", 2920, 3452}},
