Tibia was completely scattered with the corpses of the great battle,\nand all life threatened to be suffocated thereby. \nThere the gods decided that Uman should unite with the earth in order to create a godly being, which would take care of the\ndead. But Zathroth used a deception and appeared to the earth as its other side, Uman, and conceived in his place a being.\nThis was the birth of Urgith, the master of the undead. \nAnd immediately the dead ones began to raise themselves on his calling, and they all were his creatures. Like the orcs before\nthem, now the undead covered the body of the mother Tibia, and his children, the rats, were Urgith's messengers and scouts. \nThen however Uman and Tibia united, as it had been agreed upon, and Toth was born. Toth became the guardian of the\ndead ones and sent his large worms which began to devour the undead. For a long time the struggle lasted and again no end\nwas to be foreseen.

You will find dungeons somewhere in the wilderness.\nDon't enter dungeons without equipment. Especially a rope and a shovel will prove valuable.
